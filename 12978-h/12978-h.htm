    <h2>PREFACE</h2>

    <p>I am a Gravestone Rambler, and I beg you to bear me
    company.</p>

    <p>This Book is not a Sermon. It is a lure to decoy other
    Ramblers, and the bait is something to ramble for. It also
    provides a fresh object for study.</p>

    <p>Old-lore is an evergreen tree with many branches. This is a
    young shoot. It is part of an old theme, but is itself new.</p>

    <p>Books about Tombs there are many, and volumes of Epitaphs by
    the hundred. But of the Common Gravestones&mdash;the quaint and
    curious, often grotesque, headstones of the
    churchyard&mdash;there is no record.</p>

    <p>These gravestones belong to the past, and are hastening to
    decay. In one or two centuries none will survive unless they be
    in Museums. To preserve the counterfeit presentment of some
    which remain seems a duty.</p>

    <p>Many may share the quest, but no one has yet come out to
    start. Let your servant shew the way.</p>

    <p>I begin my book as I began my Rambles, and pursue as I have
    pursued.</p>

    <h3>OLD GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>I was sauntering about the churchyard at Newhaven in Sussex,
    reading the inscriptions on the tombs, when my eyes fell upon a
    headstone somewhat elaborately carved. Although aged, it was in
    good preservation, and without much trouble I succeeded in
    deciphering all the details and sketching the subject in my
    note-book. It is represented in Fig. 1.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/fig1.jpg"
             name="fig1"
             target="blank"
             id="fig1"><img width="100%"
             src="images/fig1.jpg"
             alt="FIG. 1. NEWHAVEN." /></a>
    </div>

    <p class="figx">FIG. 1&mdash;AT NEWHAVEN, SUSSEX.</p>

    <p>The inscription below the design reads as follows:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Here lyeth the remains of Andrew Brown,</p>

            <p class="i4">who departed this life the 14th day
            of</p>

            <p class="i4">January 1768, aged 66 years. Also of</p>

            <p class="i4">Mary his wife, who departed this life
            the</p>

            <p class="i4">3d day of July 1802, aged 88 years."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This was the first time I had been struck by an allegorical
    gravestone of a pronounced character.</p>

    <p>The subject scarcely needs to be interpreted, being
    obviously intended to illustrate the well-known
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"
       id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span> passage in the Burial Service:
       "For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
       ... then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
       written, Death is swallowed up in Victory. O death, where is
       thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" The reference in
       another ritual to the Lord of Life trampling the King of
       Terrors beneath his feet seems also to be indicated, and it
       will be noticed that the artist has employed a rather
       emphatic smile to pourtray triumph.</p>

    <p>It was but natural to suppose that this work was the
    production of some local genius of the period, and I searched
    for other evidences of his skill. Not far away I found the next
    design, very nearly of the same date.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/fig2.jpg"
             name="fig2"
             target="blank"
             id="fig2"><img width="100%"
             src="images/fig2.jpg"
             alt="FIG. 2. NEWHAVEN." /></a>
    </div>

    <p class="figx">FIG. 2.&mdash;AT NEWHAVEN, SUSSEX.</p>

    <p>The words below were:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"To the memory of Thomas, the son of</p>

            <p class="i4">Thomas and Ann Alderton, who departed</p>

            <p class="i4">this life the 10th day of April 1767, in
            the</p>

            <p class="i4">13th year of his age."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The same artist almost of a certainty produced both of these
    figurative tombstones. The handicraft is similar, the idea in
    each is equally daring and grotesque, and the phraseology of
    the inscriptions is nearly identical. I thought both
    conceptions original and native to the place, but I do not
    think so now. In point of taste, the first, which is really
    second in order of date, is perhaps less questionable than the
    other. The hope of a joyful resurrection, however rudely
    displayed, may bring comfort to wounded hearts; but it is
    difficult to conceive the feelings of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"
       id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span> bereaved parents who could
       sanction the representation of a beloved boy, cut off in the
       brightest hour of life, coffined and skeletoned in the
       grave!</p>

    <p>Above the coffin on Alderton's headstone is an ornament,
    apparently palms. It is not unusual to find such meaningless,
    or apparently meaningless, designs employed to fill in
    otherwise blank spaces, though symbols of death, eternity, and
    the future state are in plentiful command for such purposes.
    Something like this same ornament may be found on a very old
    flat stone in the churchyard of Widcombe, near Bath. It
    stretches the full width of the stone, and is in high relief,
    which has preserved it long after the accompanying inscription
    has vanished. The probable date may be about 1650.</p>

    <p>In Newhaven Churchyard, though there are but these two
    striking examples of the allegorical gravestone, there is one
    other singular exemplification of the graver's skill and
    ingenuity, but it is nearly a score of years later in date than
    the others, and probably by another mason. It represents the
    old and extinct bridge over the Sussex Avon at Newhaven, and it
    honours a certain brewer of the town, whose brewery is still
    carried on there and is famous for its "Tipper" ale. Allowing
    that it was carved by a different workman, it is only fair to
    suppose that it may have been suggested by its predecessors.
    Its originality is beyond all question, which can very rarely
    be said of an old gravestone, and, as a churchyard record of a
    local institution, I have never seen it equalled or
    approached.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"

            <p>Nor heedless pass where TIPPER'S ashes lay.</p>

            <p>Honest he was, ingenuous, blunt, and kind;</p>

            <p>And dared do, what few dare do, speak his mind.</p>

            <p>Be better, wiser, laugh more if you can."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>That these were all the especial eccentricities of this
    burial-place disappointed me, but, with my after-knowledge, may
    say that three such choice specimens from one enclosure is a
    very liberal allowance.</p>

    <p>Suspecting that sculptors of the quality necessary for such
    high-class work would be unlikely to dwell in a small and
    unimportant fisher-village such as Newhaven was in the middle
    of the eighteenth century, I went over to Lewes, the county
    town being only seven miles by railway. But I found nothing to
    shew that Lewes was the seat of so much skill, and I have since
    failed to discover the source in Brighton or any other adjacent
    town. Indeed, it may be said at once that large towns are the
    most unlikely of all places in which to find peculiar
    gravestones. At Lewes, however, I lighted on one novelty
    somewhat to my purpose, and, although a comparatively simple
    illustration, it is not without its merits, and I was glad
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> to add it to my small
       collection. The mattock and spade are realistic of the
       grave; the open book proclaims the promise of the heaven
       beyond.</p>

    <p>The coincidence of date would almost warrant a belief that
    this piece of imagery may have emanated from the same brain and
    been executed by the same hands as are accountable for the two
    which we have seen seven miles away, but the workmanship is
    really not in the least alike, and I have learnt almost to
    discard in this connection the theory of local idiosyncrasies.
    Even when we find, as we do find, similar, and almost
    identical, designs in neighbouring churchyards, or in the same
    churchyard, it is safer to conjecture that a meaner sculptor
    has copied the earlier work than that the first designer would
    weaken his inventive character by a replication. The following,
    which cannot be described as less than a distortion of a
    worthier model, is to be found in many places, and in such
    abundance as to suggest a wholesale manufacture.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/fig6.jpg"

    <p>It is obvious that the idea intended to be represented is
    figurative of death in infancy or childhood, and illustrates
    the well-known words of the Saviour, "Suffer little children to
    come unto me, and forbid <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> them not: for of such is the
       kingdom of God," quoted on the stone itself. In this and
       many similar cases in which the design and text are used for
       old or elderly people, they have been certainly strained
       from their true significance. The figure of a little child
       is, however, employed occasionally to represent the soul,
       and may also be taken to indicate the "new birth."</p>

    <p>There is an almost exact reproduction of the foregoing
    example in the same churchyard, even more remarkably at
    variance with Scriptural interpretation.</p>

    <p>It is dedicated</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"To John Clark, died 1793, aged 62 years;</p>

            <p class="i4">and Rebecca his wife, died 1794, aged
            61</p>

            <p class="i4">years."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The inscription adds:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"What manner of persons these were the last</p>

            <p class="i10">day will discover."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Gravestone plagiarism of this sort is very common, and there
    is to be found at West Ham, Essex, the same symbolical flight
    of the angel and child repeated as many as five times.</p>

    <p>The pilfering is not so weak and lamentable when the copyist
    appropriates merely the idea and works it out in a new fashion.
    The term new can hardly be attributed to the notion of a
    plucked flower as a type of death, but it occurs in so many
    varieties as almost to redeem its conventionality.</p>

    <p>The sculptor of a stone which is in Dartford burial-ground
    probably had the suggestion from a
    predecessor.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"

    <p>But not far from it in the same burial-ground, which is
    really a cemetery separated from the parish church, and one of
    the oldest cemeteries in England, is another imitation quite
    differently brought out, but in principle essentially the

    <p>At the churchyard of Stone (or Greenhithe), two or three
    miles from Dartford, both these floral emblems are reproduced
    with strict fidelity.</p>

    <p>This first chapter and the sketches which illustrate it will
    serve to introduce and explain my work and its scope.</p>

    <p>In pursuing my investigations it was soon evident that the
    period of the allegorical gravestone was confined sharply and
    almost exclusively to the eighteenth century. I have seldom met
    one earlier than 1700, and those subsequent to 1800 are very
    rare. Of gravestones generally it may almost be said that
    specimens of seventeenth-century date are exceedingly few.
    There are reasons for this, as will afterwards appear. But the
    endurance even of the longest-lived of all the old memorials
    cannot be very much longer extended, and this may be my excuse
    for preserving and perpetuating the features of some of them as
    a not uninteresting phase of the vanishing past. I do not claim
    for my subject any great importance, but present it as one of
    the small <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> contributions which make up
       history. One other plea I may urge in my defence. This is a
       branch of study which, so far as I can ascertain, has been
       quite neglected. There are books by the score dealing with
       the marble, alabaster, and other tombs within the churches,
       there are books of epitaphs and elegies by the hundred, and
       there are meditations among the graves sufficient to satisfy
       the most devout and exacting of readers, but the simple
       gravestone of the churchyard as an object of sculptured
       interest has I believe found hitherto no student and is
       still looking for its
       historian.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"

    <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

    <h3>THE EVOLUTION OF GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>Although there may be no expectation of discovering the germ
    of the pictorial or allegorical gravestone, a section of the
    samples collected for this essay may be displayed to shew the
    earlier forms in which the ruder class of masons prepared their
    sculptured monuments for the churchyard. There is little doubt
    that the practice originated in an endeavour to imitate on the
    common gravestone the nobler memorials of the churches and
    cathedrals, the effort being more or less successful in
    proportion to the individual skill of the artist. The influence
    of locality, however, must always be a factor in this
    consideration; for, as a rule, it will be found that the
    poorest examples come from essentially secluded places, while
    localities of earlier enlightenment furnish really admirable
    work of much prior date. Take, for instance, that most frequent
    emblem, the skull. I have not sought for the model by which the
    village sculptor worked, but I have in my note-book this sketch
    of a skull, copied from a sixteenth-century tomb at Frankfort
    on the Maine, and there are doubtless a vast number equal to it
    in English cathedrals and churches of the same period.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/fig9.jpg"

    </div>

    <p class="figx">FIG. 9.&mdash;AT FRANKFORT, GERMANY.</p>

    <p>Regarding this as our ideal, the primitive work which we
    find in rural localities must be pronounced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> degenerated art. Generally
       speaking we may assume that the carver of the stately tomb
       within the church had no hand in the execution of the outer
       gravestone; but that quite early there were able masons
       employed upon the decoration of the churchyard headstone is
       shewn in many instances, of which the one presented in Fig.
       10 may serve as a very early specimen.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">

    <p>The dates are remarkable in connection with such an
    elaborate work. East Wickham is little more than a village even
    now, and this carving is very creditable in comparison with
    other attempts of the same early period; but the high road from
    London to Dover runs through the parish, and may have carried
    early cultivation into the district. All the rougher
    illustrations which I have found have been in remote and
    isolated spots, or spots that were remote and isolated when the
    stones were set up. The first of these which I discovered was
    in the little churchyard of Ridley in Kent, "far from the

    <p>It is difficult to believe that the face here delineated was
    meant to represent a skull, and yet, judging by the many
    equally and more absurd figures which I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> have since met with, there is
       little doubt that a skull was intended by the engraver, for
       this and all others of the class are incised, simply
       scratched or cut into the stone; nothing so poor in drawing
       have I ever found which has risen to the eminence of relief.
       It may, of course, be also surmised that the face here cut
       into the stone is meant for a portrait or to represent an
       angelic being. The radial lines may have been intended for a
       halo of glory or a frilled cap, but, as will be seen by
       comparison, the whole thing is easily to be classed with the
       skull series.</p>

    <p>It will be noticed that we have in this instance a form of
    headstone differing materially from those of later times, and
    wherever we find the rude <i>incised</i> figure we nearly
    always have the stone of this shape. Such homely memorials are
    distinguished in nearly every instance by dwarfishness and
    clumsiness. They are seldom more than 2 feet in height, and are
    often found to measure from 5 inches to 7 inches in thickness.
    A prolific field for them is the great marshland forming the
    Hundred of Hoo, below Gravesend, the scene of many incidents in
    the tale by Charles Dickens of "Great Expectations." It is
    called by the natives "the Dickens country," for the great
    author dwelt on the hilly verge of it and knew it well. The
    Frontispiece shews the general view of one of these old stones
    at Higham, in the Hoo district.</p>

    <p>The nimbus or nightcap again appears as in the Ridley
    specimen, but, whatever it be, the teeth are undoubtedly the
    teeth of the skeleton head.</p>

    <p>This stone has another claim to our notice beyond the
    inartistic design. It marks one of the very rare efforts in
    this direction of the seventeenth century.</p>

    <p>The prevalent shape of these old memorials and their almost
    contemporary dates seem to indicate a fashion of the period,
    but they are met with in other places of various conformations.

    <p>There is, however, another at Higham of about the same date,

    <p>That some of the carvings were meant for portraits cannot be
    denied, and, in order to shew them with unimpeachable accuracy,
    I have taken rubbings off a few and present an untouched
    photograph of them just as I rubbed them off the stones (Fig.
    17). The whole of the originals are to be found in the
    neighbouring churchyards of Shorne and Chalk, two rural
    parishes on the Rochester Road, and exhibit with all the
    fidelity possible the craftsmanship of the village sculptors.
    They will doubtless also excite some
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> speculation as to their
       meaning. My belief, as already expressed, is that the
       uppermost four are the embodiment of the rustic yearning for
       the ideal; in other words, attempts to represent the emblem
       of death&mdash;the skull. Nos. 1 and 2 are from Shorne; Nos.
       3, 4, and 5 from the churchyard at Chalk.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:50%;">

    </div>

    <p>In No. 1 we have, perhaps, the crudest conception extant of
    the skeleton head. The lower bars are probably meant for teeth;
    what the radial lines on the crown are supposed to be is again
    conjecture. Perhaps a nimbus, perhaps hair or a cap, or merely
    an ornamental finish. The inscription states that the stone was
    erected to the memory of "Thomas Vdall," who died in 1704, aged
    63 years.</p>

    <p>No. 2 has the inscription buried, but it is of about the
    same date, judging by its general appearance. The strange
    feature in this case is the zig-zag "toothing" which is
    employed to represent the jaws. Doubtless the artist thought
    that anything he might have lost in accuracy he regained in the
    picturesque.</p>

    <p>No. 3, in which part of the inscription "Here lyeth"
    intrudes into the arch belonging by right to the illustration,
    is equally primitive and artless. The eyebrows, cheeks&mdash;in
    fact all the features&mdash;are evidently unassisted studies
    from the living, not the dead, frontispiece of humanity; but
    what are the serifs, or projections, on either side? Wondrous
    as it is, there can be only one answer. They must be meant for
    <i>ears</i>! This curious effigy commemorates Mary, wife of
    William Greenhill, who died in 1717, aged 47 years.</p>

    <p>No. 4 is one of the rude efforts to imitate the skull and
    crossbones of which we find many examples. It is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> dedicated to one Grinhill
       (probably a kinsman of the Greenhills aforesaid), who died
       in 1720, aged 56 years.</p>

    <p>Most strange of all is No. 5, in which the mason leaps to
    the real from the emblematic, and gives us something which is
    evidently meant for a portrait of the departed. The stone
    records that Mary, wife of Thomas Jackson, died in 1730, aged
    43 years. It is one of the double tombstones frequently met
    with in Kent and some other counties. The second half, which is
    headed by a picture of two united hearts, records that the
    widower Thomas Jackson followed his spouse in 1748, aged 55
    years.</p>

    <p>Upon a stone adjacent, to Mary London, who died in 1731,
    there has been another portrait of a lady with braided hair,
    but time has almost obliterated it. I mention the circumstance
    to shew that this special department of obituary masonry, as
    all others, was prone to imitations. I may also remark that
    intelligent inhabitants and constant frequenters of these two
    churchyards have informed me that in all the hundreds of times
    of passing these stones they never observed any of their
    peculiarities. It ought, however, to be said that these
    primitive carvings or scratchings are not often conspicuous,
    and generally require some seeking. They are always on a small
    scale of drawing, in nearly every instance within the
    diminished curve of the most antiquated form of headstone (such
    as is shewn in the Frontispiece), and as a rule they are
    overgrown with lichen, which has to be rubbed off before the
    lines are visible. It may safely be averred, on the other hand,
    that the majority of the old stones when found of this shape
    contain or have contained these remarkable figures, and in some
    places, particularly in Kent, they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> literally swarm. There is a
       numerous assortment of them at Meopham, a once remote
       hamlet, now a station on the London, Chatham, and Dover
       Railway. I have copied only one&mdash;an early attempt
       apparently to produce a cherub resting with outstretched
       wings upon a cloud, but there are a good many of the same
       order to keep it in countenance.</p>

    <p>In the churchyards of Hawkhurst, Benenden, Bodiam,
    Cranbrook, Goudhurst, and all through the Great Weald these
    incised stones are to be discovered by hundreds, very much of
    one type perhaps, but displaying nevertheless some
    extraordinary variations. I know of no district so fruitful of
    these examples as the Weald of Kent.</p>

    <p>Even when the rude system of cutting into the stone ceased
    to be practised and relief carving became general, grossness of
    idea seems to have survived in many rural parishes. One
    specimen is to be seen in the churchyard of Stanstead in Kent,
    and is, for relief work, childish.</p>

    <p>The chaplet of bay-leaves or laurel doubtless indicates
    "Victory." Not only is this an early and well-accomplished
    effort, but it is remarkable for the presence of a lower jaw,
    which is seldom seen on a gravestone. The skull turned up by
    the sexton <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"

       object, and to that we may presume the nether jaw is not

    <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

    <h3>ARTISTIC GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>In the later half of the eighteenth century greater pains
    and finer workmanship appear to have been bestowed upon the
    symbolic figurement of the gravestone, and the more elaborate
    allegorical representations of which a few sketches have been
    given came into vogue and grew in popular favour until the
    century's end. Nor did the opening of a new century altogether
    abolish the fashion; perhaps it can hardly be said to have been
    abolished even now at the century's close, but the evidences
    extant combine to shew that the flourishing period of the
    pictorial headstone lay well within the twenty-five years
    preceding Anno Domini 1800. For the sake of comparison one with
    another, I have taken, in addition to the sketch at page 1
    (Fig. 1), three examples of the device which seems most
    frequently to typify the resurrection of the dead. In two of
    these the illustration is accompanied by a quotation
    explanatory of its subject, but the words are not the same in
    both cases. The stone at Horton Kirby, near Dartford, depicted
    in Fig. 32, shews the inscription clearly.</p>

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>

    <p>In the second instance, at Cliffe, the inscription has been
    in great part obliterated by time, but the words written were
    evidently those of the chapter from Corinthians which is part
    of the Burial Service: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
    where is thy victory?" They are, however, almost illegible, and
    I have made no attempt to reproduce them in the picture.</p>

    <p>There is a second stone of similar pattern in Cliffe
    Churchyard, dated 1790. It differs from the foregoing only in
    having the spear broken. The sculptor of another specimen at
    Darenth, near Dartford, thought the subject worthy of broader
    treatment, and transferred it to a stone about double the
    ordinary width, but did not vary the idea to any great extent.
    Indeed, Horton Kirby and Darenth, being next-door neighbours,
    have most features in common; the falling tower, which
    symbolizes the Day of Judgment, appearing in both, while it is
    absent from the more distant examples at Cliffe and Newhaven.
    The introduction of the omniscient eye in the Cliffe case is,
    however, a stroke of genius compared with the conventional palm
    branches at Horton Kirby, or the flight through mid-air of the
    tower-tops both at Horton Kirby and at Darenth.</p>

    <p>Outside the county of Kent I have met with nothing of this
    pattern, and pictorial art on a similar scale is seldom seen on
    the gravestones anywhere. Specimens from Lee, Cheshunt,
    Stapleford Tawney, and elsewhere, will, however, be seen in
    subsequent pages.</p>

    <p>The day of joyful resurrection is prefigured possibly in
    more acceptable shape in the next instance, no imitation of
    which I have seen in any of my rambles.</p>

    <p>No one to whom I have shewn this sketch has given a
    satisfactory interpretation of it, but it will be allowed that
    the design is as graceful as it is uncommon. That it also in
    all likelihood refers to the Day of Judgment may perhaps be
    regarded as a natural supposition.</p>

    <p>Even the open or half-open coffin, shewing the skeleton
    within, may possibly have some reference to the rising at the
    Last Day. We have this figure employed in a comparatively
    recent case at Fawkham in Kent, being one example of
    nineteenth-century sculpture.</p>

    <p>A crown is usually the emblem of Victory, but held in the
    hand, as in this instance, it indicates, I am told, an innocent
    life.</p>

    <p>Other coffins displaying wholly or partly the corpse or
    skeleton within are perhaps not intended to convey
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> any such pious or poetic
       thought as do the two foregoing, but simply to pourtray the

    <p>In the latter illustration there are three stars to which I
    can give no signification. The snake-ring is, of course,
    eternity, and the book, as before surmised, may stand for the
    record of a good life.</p>

    <p>More ingenious, more didactic, and altogether more
    meritorious than these is another series of designs belonging
    to the same period of time. They are not only as a rule
    conceived in better taste, but are, almost consequently, better
    in their execution. The following example from Cooling, a small
    village in the Medway Marshes, is an excellent specimen of its
    class, and a very exceptional "find" for a spot so remote.</p>

    <p>It is easy to read in this illustration the parable of death
    destroying a fruitful vine, and as a picture it is not
    inelegant. It is more remarkable as being, so far as I can
    find, the one solitary instance of an allegorical gravestone
    among the thousands of gravestones in the vast and carefully
    guarded burial-place in the City Road. Strictly speaking,
    death's heads and crossbones are allegorical, but these must be
    excepted for their very abundance and their lack of novelty.
    Possibly, also, the lichen, damp, and London climate, which
    have obliterated many of the inscriptions in this old cemetery,
    may have been fatal to the low relief which is requisite for
    figure work of the kind under consideration. But Bunhill Fields
    and similar places in and near London and other great towns
    have taught me the law to which I have already
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> referred&mdash;the law that
       the picture-tombstone was country bred, and could never have
       endured under the modern conditions of life in or near the
       centres of civilization.</p>

    <p>There are exceptions, perhaps many, to this ruling, as there
    are exceptions to every other. For instance, a stone at the
    grave of a Royal Artillery Officer in Woolwich Churchyard
    combines the emblems of his earthly calling with those of his
    celestial aspirations in a medley arrangement not unusual in
    rural scenes, but hardly to be reconciled with the education
    and refinement of a large garrison and school of military
    science which Woolwich was in 1760. This must be set down as
    one of the exceptions which prove the rule.</p>

    <p>There is a more recent case in which the same idea is
    pourtrayed in somewhat different fashion on a headstone in the
    obsolete graveyard of St. Oswald, near the Barracks at York. It
    is dedicated to John Kay, a private in the Royal Scots Greys,
    who died July 9, 1833, aged 34 years.</p>

    <p>But, on the whole, it may be accepted as an axiom that
    originality has shunned the town churchyards, and the absence
    of curious varieties of the gravestone among the well-sown
    acres of Bunhill Fields and such-like places of the period at
    which they were by comparison so abundant in less considered
    localities admits of a simple
    explanation.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>

    <p>In the eighteenth century town and country were much more
    divided than they are now. London and the rural districts were
    not on their present level. Taste in art and in the ordinary
    affairs of life was being cultivated in town; it was not even
    encouraged in the country. Education and refinement were not
    thought to be desirable accomplishments in a rustic population,
    but dwellers in cities had been for generations improving their
    manners, and thus it was that no such provincial vulgarity as a
    decorated tombstone could be tolerated in the choice
    metropolis.</p>

    <p>The clergy were always the masters in such matters, and
    their influence is seen in many places, even in the villages,
    in keeping the churchyard free from ridicule; but, broadly
    speaking, there is no doubt that the rectors and vicars in
    London and other large cities began quite a hundred years
    earlier than those of the villages that control and supervision
    over the carving and inscriptions on the tombstone which is now
    the almost universal rule. It was unquestionably the adoption
    of this practice by the country parson, late in the eighteenth
    century or early in the nineteenth century, that put an end in
    rural places to the "period" of illustrated epitaphs which had
    long gone out of fashion, or, more likely, had never come into
    being, among the busier hives of humanity.</p>

    <p>A rare variety of the cloud-and-angel series, which are so
    frequent, is seen in Longfield Churchyard on the Maidstone
    Road. Trumpets of the speaking or musical order are frequently
    introduced to typify the summons to resurrection, but here we
    have the listener pourtrayed by the introduction of an
    ear-trumpet.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"

    <p>Allegorical gravestones of recent date, that is of the time
    which we call the present day, are very seldom seen, and such
    as there are do not come within the scope of this work. There
    is one in West Wickham Churchyard devoted to a chorister, and
    sculptured with a representation of the church organ-pipes.
    Memorials to deceased Freemasons are perhaps the most frequent
    of late carvings, as in the sketch from Lydd in the Romney
    Marsh district.</p>

    <p>Churchyards beside the Upper Thames are nearly all prolific
    in old gravestones, the riparian settlements having been well
    populated during the favourable period. This is especially the
    case at Richmond and Twickenham, but of the great number of
    eighteenth-century stones in both churchyards there are few
    very remarkable. Richmond has a rare specimen of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> the <i>full-relief</i> skull.
       The death's head has on either side of it the head of an

    <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

    <h3>PROFESSIONAL GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>It is more than likely that somewhere will be found a
    pictorial accompaniment to the verse which has been often used
    as an epitaph for a village blacksmith. I have met with the
    lines in two or three versions, of which the following, copied
    in the churchyard at Aberystwith, appears to be the most
    complete:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"My sledge and hammer lie reclined;</p>

            <p>My bellows too have lost their wind;</p>

            <p>My fire extinct, my forge decay'd,</p>

            <p>And in the dust my vice is laid.</p>

            <p>My coal is spent, my iron's gone;</p>

            <p>My nails are drove, my worck is done."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>There are many instances in which the implements of his
    craft are depicted upon an artizan's tomb; these also for the
    most part being of the eighteenth century. In the churchyard at
    Cobham, a village made famous by the Posthumous Papers of the
    Pickwick Club, is a gravestone recording the death of a
    carpenter, having at the head a shield bearing three compasses
    to serve as his crest, and under it the usual tools of his
    trade&mdash;square, mallet, compasses, wedge, saw, chisel,
    hammer, gimlet, plane, and two-foot rule.</p>

    <p>This one may serve as a fair sample of all the trade
    memorials to which carpenters have been, before all classes of
    mechanics, the most prone. The carvings bear the same strong
    resemblance to each other that we find in other series of
    gravestones, but have occasional variations, as in the
    following specimen, which mixes up somewhat grotesquely the
    emblems of death and eternity with the mundane instruments of
    skill and labour, including therein a coffin lid to shew maybe
    that the man, besides being a carpenter, was also an
    undertaker.</p>

    <p>It was only to be expected that the prominent agriculturists
    of rural districts would be figuratively represented on their
    gravestones, and this will be found to be the case in a number
    of instances. The following illustration is from the churchyard
    of Frindsbury, a short distance out of Rochester and on the

    <p>The overturned sheaf presumably refers metaphorically to the

    The old-fashioned plough is cut only in single profile, but is

    <p>In the case of John Bone, bricklayer, of Bromley, Kent, it
    would probably be wrong to associate with his calling the tools
    engraved on his headstone. They were probably meant with the
    rest of the picture to represent the emblems of mortality.</p>

    <p>There is, however, one stone which may be included in the
    category of trade memorials, though its subject was not a
    mechanic. Mr. John Cade was a schoolmaster at Beckenham, and
    appears to have been well liked by his pupils, who, when he
    prematurely died, placed a complimentary epitaph over his
    grave. The means by which he had imparted knowledge are

    <p>Greenford, near Harrow-on-the-Hill, had quite recently a

    <p>The next problem is rather more doubtful, and in considering
    the possibility of the memorial indicated being "professional,"
    we must remember that the parish of West Ham, now a populous
    place, was quite out of town and almost undiscovered until a
    comparatively recent time. Its eighteenth-century gravestones
    are consequently for the most part rustic and primitive. The
    skull and other bones here depicted, decked with wheat-ears and
    other vegetation, probably have some literal reference to the
    agricultural pursuits of the deceased, although of course they
    may be only poetical allusions to the life to come.</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

    <h3>A TYPICAL TRAMP IN KENT.</h3>

    <p>This unpretentious work makes no claim to deal with the
    whole subject which it has presumed to open. Its aim is rather
    to promote in others the desire which actuates the author to
    follow up and develop the new field of antiquarian research
    which it has attempted to introduce. As old Weever says, in his
    quaint style:&mdash;"I have gained as much as I have looke for
    if I shall draw others into this argument whose inquisitive
    diligence and learning may finde out more and amende mine."</p>

    <p>This book, then, is not a treatise, but simply a first
    collection of churchyard curiosities, the greater number of
    which have been gathered within a comparatively small radius.
    It is only the hoard of one collector and the contents of one
    sketch-book, all gleaned in about a hundred parishes. Many
    collectors may multiply by thousands these results, bring out
    fresh features, and possibly points of high importance.</p>

    <p>Two chief purposes therefore animate my desire to publish
    this work. One is to supply such little information as I have
    gleaned on a subject which has by some singular chance escaped
    especial recognition from all the multitude of authors,
    antiquarians, and literary men. I have searched the Museum
    libraries, and consulted book-collectors, well-read
    archaeologists, and others likely to know if there is any work
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> descriptive of old
       gravestones in existence, and nothing with the remotest
       relation thereto can I discover.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       There are, of course, hundreds of books of epitaphs, more or
       less apocryphal, but not one book, apocryphal or otherwise,
       regarding the allegories of the churchyard. Can it be that
       the subject is bereft of interest? If so, I have made my
       venture in vain. But I trust that it is not so.</p>

    <p>The second object is to recommend to others a new and
    delightful hobby, and possibly bring to bear upon my theme an
    accumulation of knowledge and combination of light. Gravestone
    hunting implies long walks in rural scenes, with all the
    expectations, none of the risks, and few of the disappointments
    of other pursuits. From ten to fifteen miles may be mapped out
    for a fair day's trudge, and will probably embrace from three
    to six parish churchyards, allowing time to inspect the church
    as well as its surroundings. Saturdays are best for these
    excursions, for then the pew-openers are dusting out the
    church, and the sexton is usually about, sweeping the paths or
    cutting the grass. The church door will in most cases be open,
    and you can get the guidance you want from the best possible
    sources. A chat with the village sexton is seldom uninviting,
    and he can generally point out everything worth your
    observation. But the faculty of finding that of which you are
    in search <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> will soon come to you. In the
       first place, the new portion of a churchyard&mdash;there is
       nearly always a new portion&mdash;may be left on one side.
       You will certainly find no ancient memorials there. In the
       next place, you may by a little observation pick out the
       eighteenth-century stones by their shape, which is as a rule
       much more ornamented and curvilinear than those of later
       date. They may also be detected very often by the roughness
       of their backs as well as by their weather-beaten
       complexions, and with a little experience and practice the
       student may guess correctly within a few years the age of
       any particular one seen even in the distance.</p>

    <p>To tempt the reader therefore to take up the study which I
    have found so pleasant, so healthful, and so interesting, I now
    propose to place in order the proceeds of a few of my rambles,
    and shew how much success the reader may also expect in similar
    expeditions. His or her stock-in-trade should consist of a
    good-sized note-book or sketch-book of paper not too rough for
    fine lines, a B B pencil of reliable quality, and a small piece
    of sandstone or brick to be used in rubbing off the dirt and
    moss which sometimes obscure inscriptions. No kind of scraper
    should ever be employed, lest the crumbling memorial be
    damaged; but a bit of brick or soft stone will do no harm, and
    will often bring to view letters and figures which have
    apparently quite disappeared. If a camera be taken, a
    carpenter's pencil may be of service in strengthening
    half-vanished lines, and a folded foot-rule should always be in
    the pocket. A mariner's compass is sometimes useful in strange
    places, but the eastward position of a church will always give
    the bearings, and a native is usually to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> be found to point the way. A
       road map of the county which you are about to explore, or,
       if in the vicinity of London, one of those admirable and
       well-known handbooks of the field paths, is useful, and the
       journey should be carefully plotted out before the start. A
       friend and companion of congenial tastes adds, I need not
       say, to the enjoyment of the excursion. My constant
       associate has happily a craze for epitaphs, but does not
       fancy sketching even in the rough style which answers well
       enough for my work, and I have had therefore no competitor.
       Together we have scoured all the northern part of Kent and
       visited every Kentish church within twenty miles of London.
       The railway also will occasionally land us near some old
       church which we may like to visit, and it was while waiting
       half an hour for a train at Blackheath station that I picked
       up the accompanying choice specimen in the ancient
       burial-ground of Lee.</p>

    <p>In this allegory Time appears to be commanding Death to
    extinguish the lamp of Life. The sun may mean the brighter life
    beyond. The building to the right is an enigma.</p>

    <p>Often the first six or seven miles have to be encountered
    before we reach unexplored ground. The Cray Valley, for
    instance, may be cited for one day's experience. First a walk
    of seven miles to Orpington, one of the five sister churches of
    the Crays&mdash;all said to be Anglo-Saxon and of about one
    date. I must not digress to speak of churches, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> it is only reasonable to
       suppose that the student who is capable of taking up as a
       pastime the investigation of churchyards has previously
       acquired something more or less of archaeological taste, and
       will not fail to notice the churches.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       We reach the churchyard of Orpington, visit the church, and
       then my companion and I separate for our respective duties.
       I am not fortunate in securing any special prize, but it is
       well to select some object if only as a souvenir of the
       visit, and I jot down the following, which may be classed
       among the commonest order of all figurative headstones, but
       is nevertheless noticeable as a variant.</p>

    <p>The work in this instance is crude, and apparently done by
    an inexpert craftsman. The stone is, however, decayed, and it
    is possible that it is the draughtsman who has blundered. The
    two skulls, being of different sizes, suggest the male and
    female occupants of the grave, and would therefore assign the
    production to the later rather than the earlier date. The two
    bones are not often found in so lateral a position, and the
    vampire wings are clumsy in the extreme. I have collected
    varieties of the skull and crossbone character in many places,
    and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> seen the eccentricities of
       many masons in the way of wings, but have met with very few
       so far astray as these. While I am engaged in transferring
       the specimen to my book, our epitaph hunter has been round
       and discovered a treasure. I shall not trouble the reader
       with him henceforth, but I may note just this one of his
       successes as a sample of the rewards which attend his part
       in the pilgrimage. He has found a stone thus inscribed:</p>

    <p>A short walk through the village and by the Cray River
    brings us to the church of St. Mary Cray, where I secure a new
    species, in which Death is doubly symbolized by the not
    infrequent scythe and possibly also by the pierced heart. The
    latter might refer to the bereaved survivor, but, being
    a-flame, seems to lend itself more feasibly to the idea of the
    immortal soul. The trumpet and the opening coffin indicate
    peradventure the resurrection.</p>

    <p>Only a short distance farther, for the churches are small,
    we reach St. Paul's Cray, the burial-ground of which shews that
    the foregoing allegory was immediately duplicated, apparently
    by another hand, with just a little variation to redeem the
    piracy. The coffin is quite opened and empty, instead of being
    slightly open and tenanted, which is almost the only difference

    <p>The churchyard at North Cray added nothing at all to my
    collection. This was the only blank drawn that day, but a
    beautifully kept ground surrounding a delightful church well
    repaid the visit. A call at Old Bexley Church completed the
    day's work, and gave me one of the few sketches belonging to
    the nineteenth century which I have

    <h3>MORE TYPICAL TRAMPS.</h3>

    <p>How far county divisions might affect the early fashions in
    gravestones was one of my first questions, and, having seen
    much of Kent, time was soon found for a scamper through the
    country bordering Epping Forest and along the backbone of
    Essex.</p>

    <p>At Barking, just within the old Abbey gate, I came upon an
    enigmatical illustration.</p>

    <p>The signification of the four balls I am unable to suggest,
    unless they be connected in some way with the planetary system
    and point man's insignificance. They appear to emanate from a
    cloud resting upon the hour-glass, and may help the other
    emblems in symbolizing time and eternity. The nickering candle
    is also of doubtful interpretation. It may mean the brevity of
    life; it can hardly be needed, in the presence of the skull, to
    indicate death. The candle is sometimes employed alone,
    occasionally extinguished. At Woolwich there is an instance in
    which the candle is in the act of being put
    out.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"

    <p>Wanstead Churchyard is remarkable for the abundance and
    originality of its old gravestones. Here is one (Fig. 74) which
    carries more distinctly the fanciful idea suggested at West Ham
    (page 34, Fig. 63); flowers and foliage, and even fruit,
    combining with the lowered torch and summoning trumpet to tell

    <p>There are several other variations of the same symbol in the
    elegant enclosure at Wanstead Church; but the most remarkable
    of the old stones is one which has at the top corners two
    projecting skulls, the one facing nearly to the front and the
    other in profile, both standing out in full relief, carefully
    and accurately sculptured, but too ghastly to be beautiful.
    This one, the Richmond example, and the two at Ripley
    constitute my entire experience of full relief work on a mere

    <p>My excursions into Essex have been too limited in scope to
    trace or test peculiarities in that county, but I have found by
    observation in a number of counties that, although there are
    occasional evidences of local invention, or at least of local
    modification, in certain districts, the same set of types which
    prevails in one county serves pretty well for all the rest.</p>

    <p>It is well therefore to guard against disappointment.
    Pilgrimages like ours, having for their real purpose healthy
    exercise and physical enjoyment, are not to be counted failures
    when their ostensible errand seems to have borne no result. It
    is necessary for the pilgrim to be armed with some such
    reflection as this against the shafts of discomfiture. There
    have been occasions when, at the close of the day, conscious as
    I might be of the pleasant hours past, the freshened brain and
    the body reinvigorated, I have yet covetously mourned the
    scanty and valueless additions to my note-book. Other pilgrims
    may therefore take warning, be prepared for blank days in
    barren coverts, and sully not their satisfaction with regrets.
    But it will be a blank day indeed which does not carry its
    pleasures with it and store the mind with happy recollections.
    One walk on a winter's day over the hills from High Barnet to
    Edgware I reckoned sadly unproductive of the special novelties
    I sought, but it afforded me the contemplation of some
    landscapes which I can never forget, and it printed on my brain
    a little <i>papier-mach&eacute;</i>-like church at Totteridge
    which was worth going miles to see. Better fortune next time
    should be the beacon of the gentle tramp. The long jaunt I had
    from Chigwell Lane Station through the pretty but unpopulous
    country west of Theydon Bois, uneventful as it was,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> made an ineffaceable mark on
       my memory. I picture now the long and solitary walk across
       fields and woodlands, with never a soul to tell the way for
       miles and miles, crossing and recrossing the winding Roden,
       startling the partridges from the turnips, and surprising,
       at some sudden bend in the footpath, the rabbits at their
       play. It is not without excitement to steer one's course
       over unknown and forsaken ground by chart and compass. These
       needful guides then prove their value, and in a hilly
       country an altitude-barometer is a friend not to be
       despised. It is not without some pride in one's
       self-reliance to find one's self five miles from a railway
       station, as I did at Stapleford Abbotts; and, though my
       special quest was all in vain at several halting-places that
       day, I met with a Norman doorway at Lambourn Church which
       archaeologists would call a dream, the axe-work of the old
       masons as clean cut and as perfect as though it had been
       done last week; and in taking a near cut at a guess across
       country for Stapleford Tawney I mind me that I lost my way,
       or thought I had, but the mariner's needle was true, and
       emerging in a green avenue I saw before me a finger-post
       marked "To Tawney Church." I took off my hat and
       respectfully saluted that finger-post, and was soon in the
       churchyard, where I haply lighted upon one of the gems of my
       collection, the headstone sculpture of "The Good
       Samaritan."</p>

    <p>The stone at Shorne being close to the church door is well
    known to the villagers, by whom it is regarded as a curiosity.
    The schoolmaster was good enough to give me a photograph from
    which my sketch is made. But such rarities are seldom esteemed
    by, or even known to, the inhabitants of a place, and are
    passed by without heed by the constant congregation of the
    church. At Stapleford Tawney, just named, a native, the first I
    had seen for a mile or two, stopped at the unwonted sight of a
    stranger sketching in the churchyard, and I consulted him as to
    application of the parable of the Good Samaritan in the case
    under notice. His reply was that, though he had lived there
    "man and boy for fifty year," he had "never see'd the thing
    afore." He condescended, however, to take an interest in my
    explanations, and seemed to realize that it was worth while to
    seek for objects of interest even in a churchyard. This was
    decidedly better than the behaviour on another occasion of two
    rustics at Southfleet. They had passed my friend jotting down
    an epitaph, and the turn of a corner revealed me sketching a
    tombstone, when one to the other exclaimed, "Land sikes, Bill,
    if 'ere ain't another on em!"</p><br />

    <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

    <h3>EARLIER GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>Although memorials of the dead in one shape or another have
    apparently existed in all eras of ethnological history, it
    would seem that the upright gravestone of our burial-grounds
    has had a comparatively brief existence of but a few hundred
    years. This, however, is merely an inference based on present
    evidences, and it may be erroneous. But they cannot have
    existed in the precincts of the early Christian churches of
    this country, because the churches had no churchyards for
    several centuries. The Romans introduced into Britain their Law
    of the Ten Tables, by which it was ordained that "all burnings
    or burials" should be "beyond the city,"<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
       and the system continued to prevail long after the Roman
       evacuation. It was not until A.D. 742 that Cuthbert,
       eleventh Archbishop of Canterbury, brought from Rome the
       newer custom of burying around the churches, and was granted
       a Papal dispensation for the practice. The churchyards even
       then were not enclosed, but it was usual to mark their
       sacred character by erecting stone crosses, many of which,
       or their remains, are still in existence. Yet it was a long
       time before churchyard interments became general, the
       inhabitants <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> clinging to the Pagan habit
       of indiscriminate burial in their accustomed places. We hear
       nothing of headstones in the early days of Christianity, but
       there are occasionally found in certain localities inscribed
       stones which bear the appearance of rude memorials, and
       these have been regarded as relics of our National Church in
       its primitive state. It is also suggested that these stones
       may be of Druidical origin, but there is nothing to support
       the theory. Among the aboriginal Britons the custom of
       simple inhumation was probably prevalent, but there are not
       wanting evidences in support of the belief that cremation
       also was sometimes practised in prehistoric times. An
       instance of early interment was discovered in a tumulus at
       Gusthorp, near Scarborough, in 1834. In a rude coffin
       scooped out of the trunk of an oak-tree lay a human
       skeleton, which had been wrapped or clothed in the skin of
       some wild animal, fastened at the breast with a pin or
       skewer of wood. In the coffin were also a bronze spearhead
       and several weapons of flint&mdash;facts which all go to
       establish a remote date. The absence of pottery is also
       indicative of a very early period. Regarding the skins,
       however, it may be remarked that C&aelig;sar says of the
       Britons, when he invaded the island, that "the greater part
       within the country go clad in skins."</p>

    <p>Christian burials, as we have seen, cannot be dated in
    England earlier than the eighth century, and monuments at the
    grave may have possibly originated about the same period, but
    there is nothing whatever to sustain such a belief, and we
    cannot assign the earliest of existing memorials to a time
    prior to the eleventh century. Indeed it is very
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> significant to find that the
       tombs within the churches are only a trifle older than the
       gravestones outside, scarcely any of them being antecedent
       to the sixteenth century. As burials inside churches were
       not permitted until long after the churchyards were used for
       the purpose,<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       it is indeed possible that no memorials were placed in the
       edifice until Tudor days; but this is scarcely feasible, and
       the more probable explanation is that all the earlier ones
       have disappeared. Those which can boast an antiquity greater
       than that of the common gravestone are very few indeed. It
       might have been supposed that the sculptured shrine under
       the roof of the sanctuary, reverently tended and jealously
       watched, might have stood for a thousand years, while the
       poor gravestone out in the churchyard, exposed to all
       weathers and many kinds of danger, would waste away or meet
       with one of the ordinary fates which attend ill-usage,
       indifference, or neglect. This indeed has happened in a
       multitude of places. Who has not seen in ancient churchyards
       the headstones leaning this way and that, tottering to their
       fall? Are there not hundreds of proofs that the unclaimed
       stones have been used, and still serve, for the floors
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> of the churches, and actually
       for the paving of the churchyard paths? It was not thought
       strange, even within the memory of the present generation,
       to advertise for owners of old graves, with an intimation
       that on a certain date the stones would be removed; and vast
       numbers of them were thus got rid of&mdash;broken up perhaps
       to mend the roads. But still greater perils have been
       survived by the earlier of those memorials which remain to
       us, both without and within the churches. The dissolution of
       the Papal power in Great Britain was the cause of one of
       these hazards; for, towards the latter end of Henry VIII.'s
       reign, likewise during the reign of Edward VI., and again in
       the beginning of Elizabeth's, commissioners in every county
       were vested with authority to destroy "all graven images"
       and everything which seemed to savour of "idolatry and
       superstition." Under colour of this order, these persons,
       and those who sympathized in their work, gave vent to their
       zeal in many excesses, battering down and breaking up
       everything of an ornamental or sculptured character,
       including tombs and even the stained windows. Moreover we
       are told by Weever<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
       that the commission was made the excuse for digging up
       coffins in the hope of finding treasure. Elizabeth soon
       perceived the evil that was being done by the barbarous rage
       and greediness of her subjects, and issued a proclamation
       under her own hand restraining all "ignorant, malicious, and
       covetous persons" from breaking and defacing any monument,
       tomb, or grave, under penalty of fine or imprisonment. This
       checked, but did not wholly cure, the mischief; and,
       although in her fourteenth
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> year of sovereignty she
       issued another and sterner edict on the subject, the havoc
       was perpetuated chiefly by a sect or party whom Weever
       describes as "a contagious brood of scismaticks," whose
       object was not only to rob the churches, but to level them
       with the ground, as places polluted by all the abominations
       of Babylon. These people were variously known as Brownists,
       Barrowists, Martinists, Prophesyers, Solisidians, Famelists,
       Rigid Precisians, Disciplinarians, and Judaical Thraskists.
       Some who overstepped the mark paid the penalty with their
       lives. One man, named Hachet, not content with destroying
       gravestones and statuary, thrust an iron weapon through a
       picture of the Queen, and he was hanged and quartered.
       Another, John Penry, a Welshman, was executed in 1593, and
       of him was written:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The Welshman is hanged</p>

            <p>Who at our kirke flanged</p>

            <p>And at her state banged,</p>

            <p class="i4">And brened are his buks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And though he be hanged</p>

            <p>Yet he is not wranged,</p>

            <p>The de'ul has him fanged</p>

            <p class="i4">In his kruked kluks."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And there was a danger to be encountered far later than that
    which was due to the anti-Popery zealots of the Tudor dynasty.
    On the introduction of the Commonwealth there arose such a
    crusade against all forms and emblems of doctrinal import as to
    affect not only the ornaments of the churches, but the
    gravestones in the churchyards, many of which were removed and
    put to other uses or sold. The Puritans, as is well known, went
    to the extremity of abolishing all ceremony whatever at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> the Burial of the
       Dead.<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       The beautiful Service in the Book of Common Prayer, now used
       more or less by all the Reformed Christian denominations of
       England, was abolished by Parliament in 1645&mdash;that and
       the Prayer Book together at one stroke. In lieu of the
       Prayer Book a "Directory" was issued on the conduct of
       public worship, in which it was said:</p>

    <p>"Concerning Burial of the Dead, all customs of praying,
    reading, and singing, both in going to or from the grave, are
    said to have been greatly abused. The simple direction is
    therefore given, that when any person departeth this life, let
    the body upon the day of burial be decently attended from the
    house to the place appointed for public burial, and there
    immediately interred without any ceremony."</p>

    <p>Penalties were at the same time imposed for using the Book
    of Common Prayer in any place of worship or in any private
    family within the kingdom&mdash;the fine being &pound;5 for a
    first offence, &pound;10 for a second, and a year's
    imprisonment for the third.</p>

    <p>The Puritans, however, are to be thanked for stopping the
    then common practice of holding wakes and fairs in the
    churchyards&mdash;a practice traceable no doubt to the
    celebration of Saints' Days in the churches, and for that
    reason suppressed as remnants of Popery in 1627-31.</p>

    <p>It need not be said that the Burial Service and the Prayer
    Book came back with the Restoration, but the discontinuance of
    fairs in churchyards seems to have been permanent. Many
    instances, however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> have occurred in later years
       of desecration by pasturing cattle in the
       churchyards,<a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>
       and offences of this nature have been so recent that the
       practice cannot be said with confidence to have even now
       entirely ceased. But we return to the gravestones.</p>

    <p>From one cause or another it is pretty certain that for
    every old gravestone now to be seen twenty or more have
    disappeared.</p>

    <p>In Gough's "Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain" many
    instances are given of the wanton and wholesale destruction of
    church and churchyard memorials, even late in the eighteenth
    century. In some cases the church officers, as already stated,
    gave public notice prior to removal of gravestones, in order
    that persons claiming an interest in the remains might repair
    and restore them; but more frequently the stones were cleared
    away and destroyed, or put somewhere out of sight without
    observation. Sometimes this was the act of the Rector; at other
    times individuals, exercising rights of ownership, have done
    the disgraceful work, and occasionally the whole of the
    parishioners have been implicated. Gough says that the
    inhabitants of Letheringham in Suffolk, being under the
    necessity of putting their church into decent order, chose to
    rebuild it, and sold the whole fabric, monuments and all, to
    the building contractor, who beat the stones to powder, and
    sold as much at three shillings a pound for terrace (?) as came
    to eighty guineas. A portion of the fragments was rescued by
    the Rev. Mr. Clubbe, and erected in form of a pyramid in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> vicarage garden of
       Brandeston, in the same county, with this inscription:</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

    <h3>REFORM AMONG THE GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>That the state of the old churchyards in this country, down
    to the middle of the nineteenth century, was a public scandal
    and disgrace, is a remark which applies especially to London,
    where burial-grounds, packed full of human remains, were still
    made available for interments on a large scale until 1850 or
    later. The fact was the more discreditable in contrast with the
    known example of Paris, which had, as early as 1765, closed all
    the city graveyards, and established cemeteries beyond the
    suburbs. One of the laws passed at the same time by the
    Parliament of Paris directed that the graves in the cemeteries
    should not be marked with stones, and that all epitaphs and
    inscriptions should be placed on the walls, a regulation which
    appears to have been greatly honoured in the breach. In 1776
    Louis XVI., recognizing the benefit which Paris had derived
    from the city decree, prohibited graveyards in all the cities
    and towns of France, and rendered unlawful interments in
    churches and chapels; and in 1790 the National Assembly passed
    an Act commanding that all the old burial-grounds, even in the
    villages, should be closed, and others provided at a distance
    from habitations.<a id="footnotetag8"
       name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>
       Other States of Europe
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> took pattern by these
       enlightened proceedings, and America was not slow in making
       laws upon the subject; but Great Britain, and its worst
       offender, London, went on in the old way, without let or
       hindrance, until 1850, For fifteen years prior to that date
       there had been in progress an agitation against the existing
       order of things, led by Dr. G.A. Walker, a Drury Lane
       surgeon, living in a very nest of churchyard fevers, who
       wrote a book and several pamphlets, delivered public
       lectures, and raised a discussion in the public press. The
       London City Corporation petitioned Parliament in 1842 for
       the abolition of burials within the City, and a Select
       Committee of the House of Commons was at once entrusted with
       an enquiry on the subject.</p>

    <p>The following were the official figures shewing the burials
    in the London district<a id="footnotetag9"
       name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a>
       from 1741 to 1837, and it was asserted that many
       surreptitious interments were unrecorded:</p>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the same year (1842) a Export was presented to Parliament
    by the Select Committee on "The Improvement of the Health of
    Towns," and especially on "The Effect of the Interment of
    Bodies in Towns." Its purport may be summed up in the following
    quotation:</p>

    <p>"The evidence ... gives a loathsome picture of the unseemly
    and demoralizing practices which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> result from the crowded
       condition of the existing graveyards&mdash;practices which
       could scarcely have been thought possible in the present
       state of society.... We cannot arrive at any other
       conclusion than that the nuisance of interments in great
       towns and the injury arising to the health of the community
       are fully proved."</p>

    <p>Among the witnesses examined were Sir Benjamin Brodie and
    Dr. G.R. Williams.</p>

    <p>In 1846 a Bill was prepared to deal with the matter, but it
    was not until 1850 that an Act was passed "To make better
    provision for the Interment of the Dead in and near the
    Metropolis." Powers were conferred upon the General Board of
    Health to establish cemeteries or enlarge burial-grounds, and
    an Order in Council was made sufficient for closing any of the
    old churchyards either wholly or with exceptions to be
    stipulated in the order. One month's notice was all that was
    needed to set the Act in operation, and in urgent cases seven
    days; but it was found necessary in 1851 to pass another Act
    for the purpose of raising funds; and in 1852 a more stringent
    Act was put upon the Statute Book to deal summarily with the
    churchyards. This was, in the the following session, extended
    to England and Wales, the General Board of Health having
    reported strongly in favour of a scheme for "Extra-mural
    Sepulture" in the country towns, declaring that the graveyards
    of these places were in no better condition than those of
    London.</p>

    <p>Consequently, in the years which followed 1850, a general
    closing of churchyards took place throughout the Metropolis,
    and to a lesser extent throughout the kingdom, and an active
    crusade against all similar
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> burial-grounds was
       instituted, which may be said to be still in operation. The
       substitution of new cemeteries in remote and mostly
       picturesque places was of immediate advantage in many ways,
       but it did little or nothing to remedy the dilapidated
       appearance of the old graveyards, which indeed, now that
       they brought in no revenues, became in many cases painfully
       neglected, dejected, and forlorn. Happily, in 1883, the
       Metropolitan Public Gardens Association was established, and
       its influence has been very marked in the improvement of the
       old enclosures and their conversion into recreation grounds.
       The Metropolitan Board of Works, the London County Council,
       the City Corporation, public vestries, and private persons,
       have shared in the good work, but the chief instrument has
       been the Public Gardens Association.</p>

    <p>Of old burial-grounds now open as public gardens in the
    London district there are more than a hundred. Care is always
    taken to preserve the sacred soil from profane uses, games
    being prohibited, and the improvements confined to paths and
    seats, levelling the ground and planting with trees and
    flowers. The gravestones, though removed to the sides of the
    enclosure, are numbered and scheduled, and all in which any
    living person can claim an interest are left untouched. No
    stones are ever destroyed in the process of reformation, but
    previous ill-usage and natural decay have rendered very many of
    them illegible, and in another century or so all these once
    fond memorials will probably have become blank and mute.</p>

    <p>To the middle of the nineteenth century may also be assigned
    the change which we now see in the character of our
    gravestones. Quite in the beginning of the century the vulgar
    and grotesque carvings and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> Scriptural barbarisms of the
       eighteenth century had given place to a simple form of
       memorial in which it was rare to find the least effort at
       ornament; but, as soon as the Burial Acts were passed and
       the old churchyards were succeeded by the new cemeteries,
       the tasteful and elegant designs which are to be seen in
       every modern burial-ground were introduced, founded in great
       measure upon the artistic drawings of Mr. D.A. Clarkson,
       whose manifold suggestions, published in 1852, are still
       held in the highest admiration.</p><br />

    <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

    <h3>PRESERVING THE GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>Mankind in all ages and in all places has recognized the
    sanctity of the burial-place. Among the New Zealanders, when
    they were first revealed to Europeans as savages, the place of
    interment was <i>tapu</i>, or holy. The wild and warlike
    Afghanistans have also a profound reverence for their
    burial-grounds, which they speak of expressively as "cities of
    the silent." Among the Turks the utmost possible respect is
    paid to the resting-places of the dead, and nowhere, perhaps
    (says Mrs. Stone in "God's Acre"), are the burial-places so
    beautiful. The great and increasing size of Turkish cemeteries
    is due to the repugnance of the people to disturbing the soil
    where once a body has been laid. The Chinese and the
    inhabitants of the Sunda Isles (says the authority just quoted)
    seem to vie with each other in the reverence with which they
    regard the burial-places of their ancestors, which almost
    invariably occupy the most beautiful and sequestered sites. The
    graves are usually overgrown with long grasses and luxuriantly
    flowering plants. In like manner the Moors have a particular
    shrub which overspreads their graves, and no one is permitted
    to pluck a leaf or a blossom.</p>

    <p>The simple Breton people are deeply religious, and their
    veneration for the dead is intense. They are frequently to be
    seen&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;kneeling on the
    ground in their churchyards, praying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> among the graves. It may
       therefore be well believed that in the period of burial
       reform which overspread the Continent in the earlier part of
       the nineteenth century there was great opposition in
       Brittany to the establishment of remote cemeteries. The
       thought of burying elsewhere than in the parish churchyard
       was to the minds of the parishioners a species of impiety.
       When reasoned with they would answer:</p>

    <p>"Our fathers were buried here, and you would separate us
    from our dead. Let us be buried here, where our kinsfolk can
    see our graves from their windows, and the children can come at
    evening to pray."</p>

    <p>In vain they were shewn the danger of accumulating corpses
    in a place which was usually in the centre of the population.
    They shook their heads and cried:</p>

    <p>"Death comes only by the will of God."</p>

    <p>Possibly, to some extent, this feeling is universal among
    mankind. There is in our hearts an innate reverence for the
    burial-place; we tread by instinct lightly over the
    sleeping-places of the dead, and look with silent awe upon
    their tombs. The feeling being part of our humanity, we might
    suppose it to be universal, and be apt to conclude that, in our
    more primitive churchyards at least, we should find some effort
    to preserve the whole or a large proportion of the memorials
    which are there dedicated to departed merit, hallowed by love
    and made sacred by sorrow. But it may truthfully be said that
    of all the headstones (not to speak alone of <i>decorated</i>
    headstones) which were set up prior to the beginning of the
    nineteenth century, by far the greater number have disappeared!
    Indeed the cases in which the old
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> churchyards have been the
       objects of any care whatever are lamentably few, while
       attempts to preserve the old gravestones are almost unknown.
       The ordinary experience is to find the churchyard more or
       less neglected and forgotten, and the grey and aged stones
       either sinking into the earth or tottering to their fall. It
       cannot be imagined that the clergy, the wardens, and the
       sextons have failed to see these things; but they have,
       presumedly, more pressing matters to attend to, and it seems
       to be nobody's business to attend to such ownerless and
       worthless objects.</p>

    <p>Some gravediggers will tell you that the natural destiny of
    the gravestone is the grave! They will shew you the old fellows
    slowly descending into the ground, and they have heard the
    parson say perhaps that the "trembling of the earth" will in
    time shake them all inevitably out of sight. I have heard it
    mentioned as an article of belief among sextons that a hundred
    years is the fair measure of a head-stone's "life" above
    ground, but this reckoning is much too short for the evidences,
    and makes no allowance for variable circumstances. In some
    places, Keston for instance, the church is founded upon a bed
    of chalk, and out of the chalk the graves are laboriously hewn.
    It is obvious therefore that the nature of the soil, as it is
    yielding or impervious, must be a prime factor in the question
    of survival. It may be granted, however, that our progenitors
    in selecting their burial-grounds had the same preference for a
    suitable site as we have in our own day, and, notwithstanding
    exceptions which seem to shew that the church and not the
    churchyard was the one thing thought of, the law of a light
    soil for interments is <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> sufficiently regular to give
       us an average duration of a gravestone's natural existence.
       The term "natural" will apply neither to those fortunate
       ones whose lives are studiously prolonged, nor of course to
       the majority whose career is wilfully, negligently, or
       accidentally shortened. But that, under ordinary
       circumstances, the stones gradually sink out of sight, and
       at a certain rate of progression, is beyond a doubt. Two
       illustrations may help the realization of this fact, such as
       may be seen in hundreds of our churchyards.</p>

    marks a very long period of inaction.</p>

    <p>The Plumstead case (Fig. 81), though less extreme, is even
    more informing, as it seems to measure the rate at which the
    disappearance goes on; the dates on the three stones coinciding
    accurately with their comparative depths in the ground. Whether
    the motion of the earth has any influence in this connection
    need not now be discussed, because the burying of the
    gravestones may be accounted for in a simple and feasible
    manner, without recourse to scientific argument. It is
    undoubtedly the burrowing of the worms, coupled with the
    wasting action of rain and frost, which causes the phenomenon.
    Instead, however, of the sexton's supposititious century, the
    period required for total disappearance may more accurately be
    regarded as from 200 to 250 years. It has been found by careful
    observation in a few random cases that the stones subside at
    the rate of about one foot in forty or fifty years, and, as
    their ordinary height is from 5 feet to 5 feet 6 inches, we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> can readily tell, providing
       the rate rules evenly, the date when any particular stone
       may be expected to vanish. In confirmation of this theory is
       the fact that scarcely any headstones are discoverable of a
       date earlier than 1650, and whenever they have been left to
       their fate the veterans of 150 years have scarcely more than
       their heads above ground. Wherever we find otherwise, it may
       be assumed that conscientious church officers or pious
       parishioners have bethought them of the burial-ground,
       lifted up the old stones and set them once more on their
       feet. Of recent years there has grown up and been fostered a
       better feeling for the ancient churchyards, and the ivy-clad
       churches of Hornsey and Hendon may be cited as examples
       familiar to Londoners in which the taste engendered by a
       beautiful edifice has influenced for good its surroundings.
       In both churchyards are many eighteenth-century stones in
       excellent preservation. Neither place, however, has yet been
       "restored" or "reformed" in the modern sense, and there is
       no reason why it should be. In many places, as the town
       grows and spreads, it is well to convert the ancient
       graveyard into a public garden, so that it be decently and
       reverently done. But this ought never to be undertaken
       needlessly or heedlessly. There are scruples of individuals
       to be regarded, and a strong case ought always to exist
       before putting into effect such a radical change. But it
       usually happens that transformation is the only remedy, and
       nothing short of a thorough reaction will rescue God's Acre
       from the ruin and contempt into which it has fallen. Yet we
       should ever remember that, whatever we may do to the
       surface, it is still the place where our dead fathers rest.

    <p>The utilitarian impulse, though frequently blamed for the
    "desecration" of our churchyards, is really less accountable
    for these conversions than the culpable neglect which in too
    many cases has forced the only measure of correction. Therefore
    they who would keep the sacred soil unmolested should take heed
    that it be properly maintained. A churchyard is in hopeful case
    when we see the mounds carefully levelled, the stones set up in
    serried ranks, and the turf between rolled smooth and trimmed
    and swept. There is no outrage in levelling the ground. The
    Christian feeling which clings to the grave, and even to the
    gravestone, does not attach to the mound of earth which is
    wrongly called the grave. This mound is not even a Christian
    symbol. It is a mere survival of Paganism, being a small copy
    of the barrow or tumulus, of which we have specimens still
    standing in various parts of our islands and the Continent, to
    mark the sepulchres of prehistoric and possibly savage
    chieftains. No compunction should be, and probably none is,
    suffered when we remove the grave-mounds, which is indeed the
    first essential to the protection and beautification of an
    obsolete burial-place. But, if possible, let the churchyard
    remain a churchyard; for, of all the several methods which are
    usually resorted to for "preservation," the best from the
    sentimental view is that which keeps the nearest to the first
    intent. There can be no disputing that a churchyard is in its
    true aspect when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> it looks like a churchyard,
       providing it be duly cared for. Some persons of practical
       ideas will, however, favour such improvements as will banish
       the least elegant features of the place and range the more
       sightly ones midst lawns and flowers; while others, still
       more thorough, will be satisfied with nothing short of
       sweeping away all traces of the graves, and transforming the
       whole space at one stroke into a public playground. The
       choice of systems is in some degree a question of
       environment. Wherever open ground is needed for the health
       and enjoyment of dwellers in towns, it is now generally
       conceded that, with certain reservations and under
       reasonable conditions, disused churchyards&mdash;especially
       such as are neglected and deformed&mdash;shall in all
       possible cases be transferred from the closed ledger of the
       dead to the current account of the living.</p>

    <p>The following lines, which were written upon the restoration
    of Cheltenham Churchyard, may be applied to most of such
    instances:</p>

    <p>But in rural spots, where there is abundance of room and
    almost superfluity of nature, a well-kept churchyard, with all
    its venerable features, studiously protected and reverently
    cared for, is one of the best inheritances of a country life.
    Illustrations of this may occur to most observers, but as a
    case in point I may refer to Cheshunt, on the borders of
    Hertfordshire. Some distance from the town-fringed highway, the
    village church, ancient and picturesque, stands amidst its many
    generations of people&mdash;living and dead&mdash;hard by a
    little street of old-world cottages. The spot and its
    surroundings are beautiful, and the churchyard alone gives
    proof that the locality has been under the influence of culture
    from generation to generation. In few places are there so many
    and such artistic specimens of allegorical carvings on the
    headstones. The usual experience is to find one or two, seldom
    more than a dozen, of these inventions worth notice, and only
    in rare instances to light upon anything of the kind distinctly
    unique; but at Cheshunt there are more than a hundred varieties
    of sculptured design and workmanship, all the stones standing
    at the proper angle, and all in good condition.</p>

    <p>In the illustration I selected at Cheshunt the left half of
    the picture appears to denote Life and the right half Death. In
    the former are the vigorous tree, the towers and fortresses,
    the plans and working implements of an active existence. In the
    latter the withered tree, with the usual emblems of death
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> and eternity, emphasizes the
       state beyond the grave, and in the centre are mushrooms,
       probably to point the lesson of the new life out of
       decay.</p>

    <p>Hatfield is another instance of preservation without change,
    none of the old stones having, so far as one can judge, been
    allowed to sink into the earth, nor, as is too often the case,
    to heel over, to be then broken up, carted away, or put to pave
    the church and churchyard. There is quite a collection of
    primitive and diminutive headstones, carefully ranged against
    the south wall of Hatfield Church, dating from 1687 to 1700;
    and the specimens of carving in the older parts of the
    churchyard are of great number and many designs. The one which
    appears in the sketch (Fig. 83) is curious by reason of the
    peculiar decoration which fringes the upper edge of the stone.
    It is somewhat worn away, and I cannot discover whether the
    ornament was intended for some sort of aigrette, or, which it
    closely resembles at the present time, a string of skulls.</p>

    <p>There appears here, as elsewhere, to have been a tendency at
    times to repeat unduly such familiar figures as the open book,
    but, as a whole, Hatfield is a good example of a country
    churchyard. There are many other old burial-grounds
    thoughtfully kept in as good, or even better, order than the
    two here quoted; but it is for the respect shewn to the ancient
    memorials of the village fathers, rather than the churchyards
    themselves, that I have ventured to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> select them as patterns for
       imitation. There is another curious border on a stone in the
       secluded but well-kept country churchyard of Northolt,
       Middlesex.</p>

    <p>Twickenham, in the same county, but now grown into a town,
    has modified its churchyard to its needs, without much change,
    and I give it a sketch in recognition of a sufficient and not
    excessive well-doing. Neither of these two examples call for
    other remark, being of simple
    interpretation.</p><br clear="all" />

    <p>But while we find the few to be commended, what a common
    experience it is, on the other hand, to come upon a neglected
    churchyard; the crippled stones bending at all angles, many of
    them cracked, chipped, and otherwise disfigured, and the
    majority half hidden in rank weeds and grass. In some places,
    owing to climatic conditions, moss or lichen has effaced every
    sign of inscription or ornament from the old stones; and there
    are localities which appear to be really unfortunate in their
    inability to resist the destructive influence of the weather
    upon their tombs, which, perhaps because they are of unsuitable
    material, go to decay in, comparatively speaking, a few years.
    As a rule, however, these relics of our
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> ancestors need not and ought
       not to prematurely perish and disappear from the face of the
       earth. Where the graveyard is still used as a place of
       interment, or remains as it was when closed against
       interments, the sexton or a labourer should have it in
       perpetual care. The grass and weeds should be kept in
       constant check, and the tombs of all kinds preserved at the
       proper perpendicular. If not too much to ask, the
       application of a little soap and water at long intervals
       might be recommended in particular instances; but all such
       details depend upon circumstances, and may be left to the
       individual judgment. Provided there is the disposition,
       there will always be found the way and the means to make the
       holy ground a decent and a pleasant place.</p>

    <p>Reverence for the dead, especially among their known
    descendants, will generally operate as a check upon hasty or
    extravagant "improvements," and it may be expected that those
    responsible for the administration of local affairs will, for
    the most part, when they set about the beautification of their
    churchyard, decide to do what is necessary with no needless
    alterations. This plan of preservation, as already intimated,
    is probably the most desirable. But we know instances,
    especially in and around London, where good work has been done
    by judiciously thinning out the crop of tombstones, clearing
    away the least presentable features of the place, and making
    the ground prim with flower-beds and borders. To do this much,
    and to introduce a few seats, will leave the graveyard still a
    graveyard in the old sense, and requires no authority outside
    the church. It may be prudent to take a vote of the Vestry on
    the subject as a defence against irate parishioners,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> but, if nothing be done
       beyond a decorous renovation of the burial-ground, the
       matter is really one which is entirely within the functions
       of the parson and churchwardens. Moreover, although it is
       not generally known, the expenses of such works are a legal
       charge against the parish, provided the churchwardens have
       had the previous countenance of their colleagues the
       overseers. The account for the due and proper maintenance of
       the disused churchyard may be sent to the Burial Board, if
       there be such a board, and, if not, to the overseers, and
       the cost will in any case fall upon the poor-rate.
       Converting the ground absolutely into a public garden is
       quite a different matter, and, notwithstanding its
       difficulties, it is the course usually adopted. First, the
       consent of the Vestry is imperative, and every step is
       carefully measured by a stringent Act of Parliament. A
       petition for a faculty must be presented to the Bishop of
       the diocese, and before it can be granted there must be an
       official enquiry in public before the Diocesan
       Chancellor&mdash;always a profound lawyer, learned in
       ecclesiastical jurisprudence. Everybody who has any claim or
       objection as to any particular grave-space, or to the whole
       scheme altogether, has a right to be heard; all reasonable
       requests are usually granted, and the closing order, if
       made, is mostly full of conditions and reservations in
       favour of surviving relatives and others who have shewn
       cause for retaining this tomb and that stone undisturbed. In
       practice it is found that there are not very many such
       claims, but it sometimes happens that serious obstacles are
       left standing in the way of the landscape gardener. One
       almost invariable regulation requires that places shall be
       found within the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> enclosure for all the old
       stones in positions where they can be seen and their
       inscriptions read; to range them in one or more rows against
       the interior of the boundary fence is usually accepted as
       compliance with this rule. Injudicious arrangement
       occasionally obscures some of the inscriptions, but they are
       all accessible if required, and anything is better than
       extinction. It is earnestly to be hoped that at least equal
       care is taken of the memorials in burial-grounds which are
       less ceremoniously closed. Where the work is thoughtfully
       conceived and discreetly accomplished, much good and little
       harm is done to a populous place by clearing the ground,
       laying out footpaths, and planting trees and flowers. But
       the gravestone, the solemn witness "Sacred to the Memory" of
       the dead, is a pious trust which demands our respect and
       protection, at least so long as it is capable of proclaiming
       its mission. When it has got past service and its testimony
       has been utterly effaced by time, it is not so easy to find
       arguments for its preservation. There is no sense or utility
       in exhibiting a blank tablet, and I have seen without
       scruple or remorse such superannuated vestiges employed in
       repairing the church fabric. But this, be it understood, is
       only when the stone is irretrievably beyond <i>memento
       mori</i> service, and on the clear condition that it is
       employed in the furtherance of religious work. It is true
       that a stone is only a stone, whatever it may have been used
       for, but a peculiar sanctity is in most minds associated
       with the grave, and we ought not to run the risk of shocking
       tender-hearted people by degrading even the dead memorial of
       the dead to profane and secular purposes. And yet, what has
       become in too many cases of the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> old gravestones? The very old
       ones we may perhaps account for, but where are the
       middle-aged ones of the eighteenth century? It cannot be
       doubted, alas, that they have in many churchyards been
       deliberately taken away and destroyed to make room for new
       ones. Districts comprising many parishes may be pointed out
       with all their old churches in the midst of their old
       churchyards, but without one old gravestone standing. The
       rule and practice have been to quietly remove the relics of
       the forgotten sires in order to dig new graves for a new
       generation. The habit, as just said, rules by districts, and
       this is the case in most matters connected with the subject
       of this essay. It is a general and remarkable truth that
       "good" and "bad" churchyards abound in groups. The force of
       example or the instinct of imitation may explain the fact,
       but it affords a sad reflection upon the morality of the
       burial-place. Kirke White asks:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i10">"Who would lay</p>

            <p>His body in the City burial-place,</p>

            <p>To be cast up again by some rude sexton?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In my experience the chief sinner is not the city, but the
    country, sexton.</p>

    <p>Other memorials than the headstone are scarcely included in
    my subject. Few of the slate slabs which answer the purpose in
    Wales and some of the bordering counties can maintain their
    inscriptions in legible condition for a very long period, and
    they are in all respects inferior to stone in durability. This
    thought would have given no anxiety to the writer of some
    Chapters on Churchyards which appeared in "Blackwood's
    Magazine" about 1820. Said he:</p>

    <p>"In parts of Warwickshire and some of the adjacent counties,
    more especially in the churchyards
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> of the larger towns, the
       frightful fashion of black tombstones is almost
       universal&mdash;black tombstones, tall and slim, and
       lettered in gold, looking for all the world like upright
       coffin-lids.... Some village burial-grounds here have,
       however, escaped this treatment, and within the circuit of a
       few miles round Warwick itself are many small hamlet

       and grey headstones.... some half sunk into the churchyard
       mould, many carved out into cherubins with their trumpeter's
       cheeks and expanded wings, or with the awful emblems,
       death's heads and bones and hour-glasses."</p>

    <p>Of the so-called black tombstones I have seen none other
    than slate.</p>

    <p>In a short tour through Wales, in 1898, I found very few old
    headstones. Most of the memorials in the churchyards were
    constructed of slate, which abundant material is devoted to
    every conceivable purpose. There is a kind of clay-slate more
    durable than some of the native stones, and even the poorer
    slate which perisheth is lasting in comparison with the wooden
    planks which have been more or less adopted in many
    burial-places, but can never have been expected to endure more
    than a few brief years. Wherever seen they are usually in
    decay, and under circumstances so forlorn that it is an act of
    mercy to end their existence.</p>

    <h3>OLD GRAVESTONES IN IRELAND.</h3>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/fig88.jpg"
             name="fig88"

             id="fig88"><img width="100%"

             alt="FIG. 88. SWORDS." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>In entering upon a chapter dealing with "Old Gravestones in
    Ireland," one is tempted to follow a leading case and sum up
    the subject in the words: "There are no old gravestones in
    Ireland." But this would be true only in a sense. Of those
    primitive and rustic carvings, which are so distinctive of the
    eighteenth-century memorials in England, I have found an almost
    entire absence in my holiday-journey ings about
    Ireland&mdash;the churchyards of which I have sampled, wherever
    opportunity was afforded me, from Belfast and Portrush in the
    north, down to Killarney and Queenstown in the south. But there
    are unquestionably old gravestones of quite a different order
    of simplicity in the Irish burial-places, the most common type
    being the rough slab of stone, several of which are here
    sketched at random from the graveyard of the large village or
    little town of Swords, ten miles or so north of Dublin (Fig.
    88). Very few of these stones bear any inscription, and,
    according to the belief of the local residents, never have been
    carved or even shaped in any way. In one or two instances,
    however, the effort of trimming the edges of the stone is
    clearly visible, and in rare cases we see the pious but
    immature attempts of the amateur mason to perpetuate, if only
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span> by initials, the memory of
       the deceased.<a id="footnotetag10"
       name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
       Some such records still remain, but many have doubtless
       perished, for the material is only the soft freestone so
       easily obtainable in the district, and the rains and frosts
       of no great number of years have sufficed to obliterate all
       such shallow carvings; the surfaces of the laminated rock
       being even now in process of peeling off before our
       eyes.</p>

    <p>The cross and "T.L." scratched on one of the stones appears
    to be recent work, and the wonderful preservation of the stone
    to Lawrence Paine, of 1686, can only be accounted for by the
    supposition that it has long lain buried, and been lately
    restored to the light. The stone is of the same perishable kind
    as the others, and it is certain that it could not have
    survived exposure to the atmosphere, as its date would imply,
    for upwards of 200 years. It may even be found that the weather
    has chipped off the edges of the stones which now appear so
    jagged, shapeless, and grotesque; but, from recent evidences
    gathered elsewhere, it is but too probable that these rude
    pillars have been, and still are, set up as they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> come from the quarry, without
       dressing and free from any carving or attention
       whatever.</p>

    <p>Many instances may be found in which slabs of stone, or even
    slate, have been erected quite recently, the edges untrimmed,
    and the name of the deceased simply <i>painted</i> upon them
    more or less inartistically, as in the sketch from Drogheda
    (Fig. 89). Such crude examples are the more remarkable in a
    busy and thriving port like Drogheda, and amid many handsome
    monuments, than among the peasantry of the villages; and it is
    easy to imagine that if nothing more durable than paint has
    been employed to immortalize the dead in past times all traces
    must have speedily disappeared. The illustrations from Drogheda
    give the whole inscription in each case, neither having date
    nor age, nor any other particular beyond the name. The memorial
    on the left hand is of slate&mdash;the other two of freestone;
    and the slate in the northern parts of Ireland is the
    preferable of the two materials.</p>

    <p>There are at Bangor, ten miles west of Belfast, many such
    slate records, which have endured for more than a century, and
    are still in excellent preservation. One which attracted my
    especial notice at Bangor was of the professional character
    here depicted, and in memory of one of those bold privateers
    who were permitted to sail the seas on their own account in the
    old war times.</p><br clear="all" />

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>A possible explanation of the long endurance of this slate
    slab may be found in the practice which prevails in this and
    some other churchyards of giving all such memorials a
    periodical coat of paint; of which, however, in the case here
    quoted there is no remaining trace.</p>

    <p>Altogether, primitive as they may be, the gravestones of the
    last century in Ireland, so far as I have seen them, compare
    favourably with the works of the hedge-mason in England which
    we have seen in earlier chapters. Even the poor pillar of rough
    stone, unhewn, ungarnished, and bare as it is, represents an
    affectionate remembrance of the dead which is full of pathos,
    and has a refinement in its simplicity which commands our
    sympathy far above the semi-barbarous engravings of heads and
    skulls which we have previously pictured. The immaturity of
    provincial <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> art in Ireland is at least
       redeemed by an absence of such monstrous figures and designs
       as we at the present day usually associate with the carvings
       of savages in the African interior.</p>

    <p>But the eighteenth-century gravestones in Ireland are not
    all of the primitive kind&mdash;many of them being as artistic
    and well-finished as any to be found in other parts of the
    British Isles. The predominant type is the "I.H.S.," surmounted
    by the cross, which appears on probably four-fifths of the
    inscribed stones of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
    centuries in Ireland. The only instances which came under my
    notice bearing any resemblance to the incipient notions of
    human heads so frequently met with in certain parts of England
    were the three here copied (Fig. 91). Nos. 2 and 3 are taken
    from gravestones in the old churchyard near Queenstown, and the
    other appears in duplicate on one stone at Muckross Abbey by
    the Lakes of Killarney.<a id="footnotetag11"
       name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>
       The stately wreck of Muckross Abbey has in its decay
       enclosed within its walls the tombs of knights and heroes
       whose monuments stand in gorgeous contrast to the desolation
       which is mouldering around them; while on the south side of
       the ancient edifice is the graveyard in which the
       peasant-fathers of the hamlet sleep, the green mounds which
       cover them in some instances marked by carved stones taken
       from the adjacent ruins. Both Abbey and grounds are still
       used for interments, together with the enclosure about the
       little church of Killaghie on the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> neighbouring eminence&mdash;a
       church which (like a few others) enjoys the reputation of
       being the smallest in the kingdom.</p>

    </div>

    <p>I leave to the ethnologists the task of accounting for these
    abnormal carvings in the South of Ireland, and associating them
    with the like productions of the same period in the South of
    England. Or perhaps I ought rather to excuse my insufficient
    researches, which, though spread over a broad area, are yet
    confined to but a few of the many spots available, and may very
    probably have passed by unexplored the fruitful fields. But, in
    the words of Professor Stephens, the apostle of Runic
    monuments, I claim for this work that it is "only a beginning,
    a breaking of the ice, a ground upon which others may build."
    My pages are but "feelers groping out things and thoughts for
    further examination."</p><br />

    <h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

    <h3>OLD GRAVESTONES IN SCOTLAND.</h3>

    <p>A very peculiar interest attaches to the old stones which
    survive in the burial-grounds of Scotland. Regarded generally
    they are of a description quite apart from the prevalent
    features of their English and Irish prototypes. Taking the same
    period as hitherto in limiting our purview of the subject, that
    is from the latter part of the seventeenth to the early part of
    the nineteenth century, it may perhaps be said that the
    Scottish headstones are tablets of Scottish history and
    registers of Scottish character during a long and memorable
    time. The one all-prevalent feature everywhere is indicative of
    the severe piety and self-sacrifice of an age and a people
    remarkable for one of the simplest professions of faith that
    has ever existed under the Christian dispensation. The rigid
    discipline, contempt for form, and sustained humility of the
    old Covenanters are written deeply in the modest stones which
    mark the green graves of their faithful dead during a period of
    fully two hundred years. The vainglory of a graven stone to
    exalt the virtues of imperfect men and women was to them a
    forbidden thing; the ostentation even of a name carved on a
    slab was at variance with doctrine; the cravings of a poor
    humanity to be remembered after death had to be satisfied with
    bare initials, and initials are all that were written on the
    gravestones in many thousands of cases,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> probably ninety per cent, of
       the whole, throughout the eighteenth century and approximate
       years. But the rule was not without its exceptions, often of
       novel and peculiar description. The skull and crossbone
       series, so common in the south, have no place in North
       Britain; while the symbol of the cross, so frequent in
       Ireland, is very rarely to be found in any shape whatever
       within the boundaries of a Scottish burial-place. I present
       four specimen types from the old chapel-yard at
       Inverness.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/fig92.jpg"
             name="fig92"
             target="blank"
             id="fig92"><img width="100%"
             src="images/fig92.jpg"
             alt="FIG. 92. INVERNESS." /></a>
    </div>

    <p class="figx">FIG. 92.&mdash;AT INVERNESS.</p>

    <p>On the stone No. 2 the tailor's tools&mdash;shears, goose,
    and bodkin&mdash;are clear enough, and I was told that the
    figures on the stone in the lower left-hand corner (No. 3) are
    locally recognized as the shuttle and some other requisite of
    the weaver's trade. Inverness had spinning and weaving for its
    staple industries when Pennant visited the place in 1759. Its
    exports of cordage and sacking were considerable, and (says
    Pennant) "the linen manufacture saves the town above
    &pound;3000 a year, which used to go to Holland."</p>

    <p>In the 1698 example (No. 1) the short "and" (&amp;) leaves
    no doubt that W.F. &amp; J. McP. (probably McPherson and his
    wife) are there buried; and the similar information is almost
    as certainly conveyed in the manifold cases in which appears
    the sign which occupies the same position in the two lower
    stones (Nos. 3 and 4). These, however, are all of later date,
    and may be set down as developments, or rather corruptions, of
    the original form. The same signs, however, constantly occur in
    all the northern
    graveyards.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>

    <p>Scotland has also its cruder form of memorial in the rough
    unhewn slabs of native freestone, which are used in all parts
    of the British Isles wherever such material is readily
    procurable.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/fig93.jpg"

    </div>

    <p class="figx">FIG. 93.&mdash;AT BRAEMAR.</p>

    <p>Two of these slabs of different degrees are seen in my
    Braemar sketch, but both seem of one family and serve to shew
    us the unconscious evolution of a doctrinal law into a national
    custom. The employment of initials, originally the sacrifice
    and self-denial of a dissentient faith, is here, as in other
    instances, combined with the Catholic emblem of the Cross. This
    little graveyard of Braemar, lying among the moors and
    mountains which surround Balmoral, and accustomed to receiving
    illustrious pilgrims whose shoe-string the poor gravestone
    tramp is not worthy to unloose, is still used for
    indiscriminate burials, and furnishes several examples of Roman
    Catholic interments. Wherever such are found in Scotland,
    bearing dates of the eighteenth century, they are usually of
    the rough character depicted in the sketch. The recumbent slab
    in the same drawing is given to illustrate the table or altar
    stone, which throughout Scotland has been used all through the
    Covenantic period to evade the Covenantic rule of the simple
    anonymous gravestone, for such memorials are almost invariably
    engraved and inscribed with designs and epitaphs, sometimes of
    the most elaborate character. But these are not mere
    gravestones: they are
    "tombs."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>

    </div>

    <p class="figx">FIG. 94.&mdash;AT STIRLING.</p>

    <p>In all parts of Scotland at which we find departures from
    the conventional simplicity of the gravestone, the variation
    inclines abundantly towards the symbols of trade and husbandry.
    At Stirling, in the noble churchyard perched on the Castle
    Rock, the weaver's shuttle noticed at Inverness appears in many
    varieties, for Pennant tells us that in 1772 Stirling, with
    only 4000 inhabitants, was an important factory of "tartanes
    and shalloons," and employed about thirty looms in making
    carpets.<a id="footnotetag12"
       name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>
       Occasionally the bobbin is represented alone, but the
       predominant fashion is the shuttle open and revealing the
       bobbin in its place. This is as it appears in No. 1 of the
       four sketches from Stirling, where it seems to indicate,
       with the shovel and rake, a mingling of weaver and
       agriculturist. The other trade emblems speak for themselves,
       excepting the reversed figure 4 in the stone of 1710 (No.
       3). This sign has been variously interpreted, but the most
       reliable authorities say that it is a merchant's mark used
       not only in Stirling but in other parts of Scotland, if not
       of England. There are in Howff Burial-ground, Dundee, and in
       many country churchyards round about that town and Stirling,
       numerous varieties of this figure, some having the "4" in
       the ordinary unreversed shape, some with and some without
       the <b>*</b>, some of both shapes resting on the letter
       "<b>M</b>," and others independent of any support whatever.
       It has also been supposed to have some connection with the
       masons' <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> marks frequently to be seen
       in old churches, and is even regarded as possibly of

    <p class="figx">FIG. 95.&mdash;AT BLAIRGOWRIE.</p>

    <p>The stone copied at Blairgowrie is an enigma which I
    scarcely dare to unravel, but it will admit of several
    interpretations. "I.E." probably stands for John Elder and
    "M.H." for his "spouse," but to set out John Elder's name in
    full, and at the same time to insert his initials, shews either
    a misconception of, or disregard for, the principles and usages
    of the Presbytery. Otherwise, in some respects, this example is
    almost worthy to be classed with the more degenerate forms of
    churchyard sculpture in England; the skull, the crown, the
    hour-glass, the coffin, and the bones being all well-known and
    conventional signs. The compasses may stand for John Elder's
    profession, but the figure which resembles a cheese-cutter,
    just below the crown, can only be a subject of conjecture. This
    stone, which is one of the least artistic I have met with in
    Scotland, is an evidence to shew that the rural sculptor was as
    ready in the north as in the south to blossom forth had he not
    been checked by the rigours of the Church. At times indeed the
    mortal passion for a name to live to posterity was too strong
    to be altogether curbed, as we may see manifested even in the
    prescribed initials when they are moulded of heroic size, from
    8 to 10 inches being no uncommon height. Remarkable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> also is the fact just
       mentioned (page 86) that, concurrently with the erection of
       these dumb headstones, there were flat or table
       stones<a id="footnotetag14"
       name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>
       allowed, upon which not only were the names and virtues of
       the departed fully set forth, but all sorts of emblematical
       devices introduced. The table tomb was probably in itself a
       vanity, and, the boundary passed, there appears to have been
       no limit to its excesses. There are a great many instances
       of this at Inverness, Aberdeen, Keith, Dunblane, and
       elsewhere, and the stone which appears in the sketch from
       Braemar is only one of several in that very limited space.
       Such exceptional cases seem to indicate some local
       relaxation from the austerity of the period, which was
       apparently most intense in the centres of population.
       Humility at the grave extended even to the material of the
       gravestone. At Aberdeen, the Granite City, few of the
       last-century gravestones are of any better material than the
       soft sandstones which must have been imported from Elgin or
       the south. The rule of initials was almost universal. In
       like manner, when it became the custom to purchase
       grave-spaces, the simplest possible words were employed to
       denote the ownership. I noticed one stone in Aberdeen
       bearing on its face the medallion portrait of a lady, and
       only the words of Isaiah, chapter xl. verse 6: "The voice
       said, All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is
       as the flower of the field." At the back of the stone is
       written: "This burying ground, containing two graves,
       belongs to William Rait, Merchant. Aberdeen, 1800." The
       practice of carving on both faces of the headstone is very
       common in Scotland, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> and, so far as I have
       observed, in Scotland alone; but, strange as it may seem,
       Scotland and Ireland when they write gravestone inscriptions
       have one habit in common, that of beginning their epitaphs,
       not with the name of the deceased person, but with the name
       of the person who provides the stone. Thus:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

    <h3>OLD GRAVESTONES ABROAD.</h3>

    <p>"Abroad" is a big place, and no sufficient treatment under
    the head of this chapter is possible except to one who has had
    very great experience and extended research. Nevertheless I
    may, with all due diffidence and modesty, tell the little I
    know on the subject. My opportunities of investigation have
    been few, and restricted to a limited area&mdash;so restricted
    and so limited that I cannot tell whether or not the
    observations I have made may be taken as indications of
    national habits or merely as idiosyncrasies of the people
    inhabiting the particular localities which I was able to visit.
    All the churchyards which I have seen in France, Belgium,
    Germany, and Switzerland very much resemble each other, and are
    altogether unlike the graveyards of Great Britain and her
    children. It is to the villages we should naturally go for
    primitive memorials of the dead, but in all the continental
    villages which I have visited memorials of a permanent
    character, either old or new, are scarcely to be seen.
    Occasionally a stone slab may be encountered, but almost always
    of recent date. At Laufen in the Canton of Zurich, near the
    Falls of the Rhine, I selected almost at random the examples of
    memorials shewn in my sketch (Fig. 96), one or other of which
    was at the head of nearly every
    grave.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"

    <p>The average height of these mementoes was about 2 feet, and
    all the dates which I saw were of the last twenty-five years.
    Permanence indeed is apparently not considered as it is with us
    in the like circumstances. The British gravestone is trusted to
    perpetuate at least the names of our departed friends down to
    the days of our posterity, but the provision made by our
    neighbours seems to have been for the existing generation only.
    Posterity does not trouble the villagers of Switzerland nor
    their prototypes of other nations around them. This fact was
    strongly exemplified at Neuhausen, a small place on the other
    bank of the Rhine, "five minutes from Germany" we were
    told.</p>

    <p>In the churchyard at this place was one handsome tombstone,
    shewn in the drawing, erected apparently in 1790. This was
    evidence of somewhat ancient art, and I looked about for the
    old gravestones which should have kept it company. Erect in its
    place there was not one, but in the remotest corner of the
    enclosure I came upon several stones lying flat, one upon
    another, the uppermost and only visible inscription bearing the
    recent date of 1870! Only twenty years or so "on sentry" at the
    grave, and already relieved from duty! There was likewise a
    miscellaneous heap of old crosses, etc., of iron and wood, the
    writing on which had disappeared, and they might reasonably
    have been condemned as of no further service; but that
    gravestones in perfect <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> preservation should have been
       thought to have served their full purpose in a little over
       twenty years, and be cast aside as no longer requisite, was
       a remarkable lesson in national character. All the graves
       were flat, and at the head of every recent one was a small
       iron slab bearing a number. Many of those which had crosses
       were hung with immortelles, composed generally of
       glass-beads.</p>

    <p>In Neuhausen Graveyard, at the end of the row of graves, are
    seen two rings protruding from the ground. Lying near is an
    iron shield with two similar rings surmounting it. It is
    readily supposed that the first-named rings are also attached
    to a shield buried in the earth, and so it proves. In order
    that no space may be lost between the graves, the shields are
    used alternately to serve as the dividing wall, and are then
    drawn out, thus enabling the sexton to pack the coffins close
    together.</p>

    <p>The towns and cities abroad have their cemeteries beyond the
    outskirts, as is the practice here. Occasionally an old
    churchyard is to be met with, but never an old gravestone as we
    know it. Still there are instances in which ancient carvings of
    the same character have been saved by attachment to the church
    or churchyard wall. Several such are to be seen in German
    churchyards long since converted to purposes of recreation, and
    one at Heidelberg may be taken as an example.</p>

    <p>At Lucerne, tinder similar conditions, the striking figures
    of two skeletons, partly in military garb, keep guard over the
    tablet which records the virtues of a departed hero. He was
    probably a soldier, but the figure of a <i>lictor</i> on the
    left with his <i>fasces</i> of axe and rods seems to betoken
    some civil employment. In ancient times the <i>lictors</i>

    <p>The two last-given illustrations may possibly belong to the
    category of mural tablets rather than that of gravestones,
    being fixed apparently by original design, and not by
    afterthought, as in our "converted" burial-grounds, against the
    outer walls of the church. There are, however, no other remains
    which I could discover bearing any resemblance to the old
    British headstone, and the evanescent character which seems to
    have attached for a certain period to the memorials of the dead
    among our neighbours abroad forbids the expectation that any
    such as those which have appeared in our earlier chapters are
    to be found in Europe outside the boundaries of our Empire. In
    more modern observances, especially in the centres
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> of population, English and
       continental manners more nearly approximate; and in the many
       new cemeteries which are now to be found adjacent to the
       cities and large towns of Western Europe there are tombs and
       gravestones as many and as costly as are to be found in any
       round London. In Germany the present practice appears to be
       single interments, and one inscription only on the stone,
       and that studiously brief. Thus:</p>

    <div class="box">
        <p>Eduard Schmidt<br />
        Geb d. 8 Oct., 1886.<br />
        Gest d. 10 Jan., 1887.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This I copied in the cemetery at Schaffhausen. But at
    Hendon, a north-west suburb of London, has recently been placed
    against the church wall a still simpler memorial, a small slab
    of marble, inscribed:</p>

    <div class="box">
        <p>Carl Richard Loose<br />
        B. 21. 1. 52: D. 14. 10. 81.</p>

    <p>For brevity <i>in excelsis</i> the following, from the
    cemetery at Heidelberg, can hardly be eclipsed:</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

    <h3>VERY OLD GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>Although, for reasons already explained or surmised, the
    gravestones in our burial-grounds seldom exceed an age of 200
    years, there has probably been no time and no race of men in
    which such memorials were unknown. Professor Dr. John Stuart,
    the Scottish antiquary,<a id="footnotetag15"
       name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>
       opines that "the erection of stones to the memory of the
       dead has been common to all the world from the earliest
       times," and there are many instances recorded in the Old
       Testament, as when Rachel died and Jacob "set a pillar upon
       her grave" (Genesis, chapter xxxv. verse 20); and another
       authority, Mr. R. R. Brash,<a id="footnotetag16"
       name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a>
       in a similar strain, comments on the sentiment which appears
       to have been common to human nature in all ages, and among
       all conditions of mankind, namely a desire to leave after
       him something to perpetuate his memory, something more
       durable than his frail humanity. This propensity doubtless
       led him in his earliest and rudest state to set on end in
       the earth the rough and unhewn pillar stone which he found
       lying prostrate on the surface, and these hoar memorials
       exist in almost every
       country.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>

    <p>A remarkable instance is afforded by Absalom, the son of
    David, who himself set up a stone to record his memory: "Now
    Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
    pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son
    to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after
    his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place"
    (2 Samuel, chapter xviii. verse 18).</p>

    <p>Professor Stuart indeed declares that there is no custom in
    the history of human progress which serves so much to connect
    the remote past with the present period as the erection of
    pillar stones. We meet with it, he says, in the infancy of
    history, and it is even yet, in some shape or other, the means
    by which man hopes to hand down his memory to the future. The
    sculptured tombs of early nations often furnish the only key to
    their modes of life; and their memorial stones, if they may not
    in all cases be classed with sepulchral records, must yet be
    considered as remains of the same early period when the rock
    was the only book in which an author could convey his thoughts,
    and when history was to be handed down by memorials which
    should always meet the eye and prompt the question, "What mean
    ye by these stones?"</p>

    <p class="center">THE BRESSAY STONE FIG. 100.</p>

    <p>To such remote antiquity, however, it is probably
    undesirable to follow our subject. It will no doubt be thought
    sufficient for this essay if we leave altogether out of view
    the researches which have been made in the older empires of the
    earth, and confine ourselves to the records of our own country.
    Of these, however, there are many, and they are full of
    interest. In date they probably occupy a period partly Pagan
    and partly Christian, and it has been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> conjectured that all or most
       of those discovered had their source in Ireland, with a
       possibility of an earlier importation into Ireland by
       Icelandic, Danish, or other peoples. Many of these stones
       have been found buried in the ruins of old churches, and
       most of them may be supposed to owe their preservation to
       some such protection. The drawings of one or two may be
       given as samples. Those here sketched (Figs. 100 and 101)
       are in the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and
       occupy with others a considerable space, being well
       displayed to shew the inscriptions on both
       sides.<a id="footnotetag17"
       name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>
       It is by the fact of both sides being written upon that we
       assign to them the character of gravestones, that is upright
       gravestones; but it is also well authenticated by historical
       records that the memorial of a Pagan chief in Ireland was a
       cairn with a pillar stone standing upon it, and there is
       little doubt that the Irish invaders carried the practice
       with them into Scotland. It is indeed in Scotland that a
       large proportion of these stones have been discovered, and
       there are more than a hundred of them in the Edinburgh
       Museum. In the Museum at Dublin there is also a good
       collection, conveniently arranged; but the British Museum in
       London has less than half a dozen&mdash;only
       five&mdash;specimens. The number in each of the three
       museums fairly represents the relative abundance of such
       remains in England, Scotland, and Ireland. Marked on a chart
       the discoveries are thickly grouped in the North-Western
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> parts of Scotland, in the
       South of Ireland, and on the South-Western promontory of
       Wales. In Cornwall and Devonshire, along the coast line,
       there have been found a goodly few, and the others are
       dotted sparsely over the whole kingdom&mdash;England, as
       just indicated, furnishing only a modicum.</p>

    <p>The inscriptions upon such stones, when they are inscribed,
    are usually in Ogam or Runic characters. An example of the Ogam
    writing is shewn on the edges of the Bressay stone (Fig. 100),
    and also on the front side of the Lunnasting stone (Fig. 101a).
    The Ogam style was used by the ancient Irish and some other
    Celtic nations, and the "Ogams," or letters, consist
    principally of lines, or groups of lines, deriving their
    signification from their position on a single stem, or chief
    line, over, under, or through which they are drawn,
    perpendicularly or obliquely. Curves rarely occur; but some are
    seen in the inscription on the Bressay stone, which has been
    thus interpreted by Dr. Graves, Bishop of Limerick: "Bentire,
    or the Son of the Druid, lies here." "The Cross of Nordred's
    daughter is here placed." This stone was found by a labourer
    about 1851, while digging in a piece of waste ground near the
    ruinous church of Culbinsgarth at Bressay, Shetland. The design
    is said to be thoroughly Irish, and the inscription a mixture
    of Irish and Icelandic. The stone measures 4 ft. by 1 ft. 4-1/2
    in. by 2 in. It is attributed to the ninth century.</p>

    <p>The stone 101a is a slab of brownish sandstone, 44 in. by 13
    in. by 11/2 in., from Lunnasting, also in Shetland. It was
    found five feet below the surface in 1876, and, having probably
    lain there for centuries, was in excellent preservation. The
    authorities, however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> are unable to make a
       satisfactory translation. The cross or dagger is also of
       doubtful explanation; and Mr. Gilbert Goudie thinks it is a
       mere mason's mark. It is, however, admitted on all hands
       that the stone is of Christian origin, and probably of the
       period just subsequent to the termination of the Roman rule
       in Britain. It has been suggested that most of these ancient
       gravestones were carved and set up by the Irish missionary
       monks not earlier than A.D. 580. The Ogam inscription on the
       Lumasting stone has been made by one expert to read:</p>

    <p class="center"><b>EATTUICHEATTS MAHEADTTANNN<br />
     HCCFFSTFF NCDTONS.</b></p>

    <p>A strange and inexplicable aggregation of consonants.</p>

    <p>The stone represented below, 101 <i>b</i>, bears an
    inscription in Runic characters. Runic is a term applied to any
    mysterious writing; but there were three leading classes of
    "runes"&mdash;Scandinavian, German, and Anglo-Saxon&mdash;all
    agreeing in certain features, and all ascribed by some
    authorities to the Phoenicians. The stone 101 <i>b</i> was
    found in 1865, at Kilbar, Barra, a remote island of the outer
    Hebrides, off the north-west coast of Scotland. It measures 6
    ft. 5-1/2 in. in height, and its greatest width is 15-1/2
    inches. Mr. Carmichael has conjectured that it was probably
    brought from Iona about the beginning of the seventeenth
    century, and erected in Barra at the head of a grave made by a
    son of McNeil for himself. But it is believed to have been in
    any case a Norse memorial in the first instance, though
    certainly Christian, for it
    reads:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

    <p>"Ur and Thur Gared set up the stones of
    Riskar.<a id="footnotetag18"
       name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>
       May Christ guard his soul."</p>

    <p>The Barra stone has on the reverse side a large cross,
    carved in plaited bands. Dr. Petrie has pointed out that the
    cross is not necessarily indicative of belief, the ancient
    Danes and other peoples having used various signs&mdash;the
    cross frequently&mdash;to mark their boundaries, their cattle,
    and their graves.<a id="footnotetag19"
       name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>
       There is little doubt, however, that in most of these
       British and Irish memorials, although the stones may
       originally have been Pagan, the cross is typical of
       Christianity. We are told that it was not unusual for St.
       Patrick to dedicate Pagan monuments to the honour of the
       true God. On one occasion, it is related, on the authority
       of an ancient life of the Saint, that, on coming to the
       Plain of Magh Solga, near Elphin, he found three pillar
       stones which had been raised there by the Pagans, either as
       memorials of events or for the celebration of Pagan rites,
       on one of which he inscribed the name of Jesus, on another
       Soter, and on the third Salvator, along probably with the
       cross, such as is seen on nearly every Christian monument in
       Ireland. In the same way on two of five upright pillars in
       the parish of Maroun, Isle of Man, are crosses deeply
       incised. This spot is traditionally associated with St.
       Patrick as the place where he preached, and the stones
       appear to be remains of a Druidical circle.</p>

    <p>This practice is quite consistent with the principles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> upon which the Christian
       conversion was established by the early missionaries. Thus,
       Gregory, in a letter from Rome, in 601, directed that the
       idolatrous temples in England should not be destroyed, but
       turned into Christian churches, in order that the people
       might be induced to resort to their customary places of
       worship; and they were even allowed to kill cattle as
       sacrifices to God, as had been their practice in their
       previous idolatry. Hence also arose the system of
       establishing new churches on the sites previously held as
       consecrated by heathen worship.</p>

    <p>Of the five old gravestones in the British Museum, four are
    from Ireland and one from Fardell in Devonshire. The Fardell
    stone was found about the year 1850, acting as a footbridge
    across a small brook at Fardell, near Ivybridge,
    Devonshire&mdash;a district once inhabited by a Celtic tribe.
    It is of coarse granite, 6 ft. 3 in. high, 2 ft. 9 in. broad,
    and from 7 to 9 inches thick. It bears an Ogam inscription on
    two angles of the same face, and debased Roman characters on
    the front and back. It reads, according to Mr. Brash, in the
    Ogam, "Safagguc the son of Cuic;" and, in the Roman, "Fanon the
    son of Rian."</p>

    <p>The three Irish Ogam stones were presented to the British
    Museum by Colonel A. Lane Fox, F.S.A., who dug them out of an
    ancient fort at Roovesmore, near Kilcrea, on the Cork Railway,
    where they were forming the roof of a subterranean chamber. No.
    1 cannot be positively deciphered or translated; No. 2 is
    inscribed to "the son of Falaman," who lived in the eighth
    century, and also to "the son of Erca," one of a family of
    Kings and Bishops who flourished in the ancient kingdom of
    Ireland; and No. 3, which is damaged, is supposed to have been
    dedicated to a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> Bishop Usaille, about A.D.
       454. All the stones came probably from some cemetery in the
       district in which they were found.</p>

    <p>It has been remarked that the distribution of these old
    stones marks clearly the ancient history of our islands; their
    frequency or rarity in each case corresponding accurately with
    the relations existing in remote times between Ireland on the
    one side, and Wales, Cornwall, and Scotland on the other.
    Further enquiry into the subject is scarcely to be expected in
    this rudimentary work.</p>

    <p>To seek for the germ of the gravestone is indeed a far
    quest. Like the <i>ignis fatuus</i>, it recedes as we seem to
    approach it. In the sculpture galleries of the British Museum
    there are several examples preserved to us from the ancient
    Empire of Assyria, and one described as the "Monolith of
    Shahnaneser II., King of Assyria, B.C. 850," is almost the
    exact counterpart of the headstones which are in vogue to-day.
    It stands 5 ft. 6 in. high, is 2 ft. 9 in. wide, and 8 inches
    thick. Like the Scottish stones of the eighteenth and
    nineteenth centuries it is inscribed on both faces.</p><br />

    <h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

    <h3>THE REGULATION OF GRAVESTONES.</h3>

    <p>It has been already pointed out, and is probably well known,
    that the clergyman of the parish church has possessed from
    immemorial time the prerogative of refusing to allow in the
    churchyard under his control any monument, gravestone, design,
    or epitaph which is, in his opinion, irreverent, indecorous, or
    in any way unbecoming the solemnity and sanctity of the place.
    This authority, wherever exercised, has been subject to the
    higher jurisdiction of the Diocesan Bishop, and presumably to
    the rule of the Ecclesiastical Courts; but, as we have seen,
    the authority has been but indifferently employed, and the
    inference is that the clergy have in times past been wofully
    ignorant or lamentably careless as to their powers and
    obligations. A more healthy system now prevails, and we seldom
    or never find anything in the way of ornament, emblem, or
    inscription of an offensive or ridiculous character placed in
    any of our burial-grounds, the Burial Boards being as strict
    and watchful over the cemeteries as the rectors and vicars are
    in the management of the churchyards. Nor has there been, so
    far as we have gone, any difficulty in reconciling this
    stringency of supervision with the Acts of Parliament which
    have been passed in recognition of religious equality at the
    grave; and it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> is not too much to hope
       that there is in the present day such universal prevalence
       of good taste and propriety under the solemnity of death as
       to ensure concurrence among all sects and parties in
       securing decorum in all things relating to interments. To
       the incongruities which have been left to us as legacies
       from our ancestors we may be indulgent. They are landmarks
       of the generations which created them, and records of times
       and manners which we would fain believe that we have left
       behind in these days of better education and better thought.
       They are therefore of value to us as items of history, and,
       though we would not repeat many of them, we shall preserve
       them, not only because we reverence the graves of our
       forefathers, but because they are entitled to our protection
       as ancient monuments. However uncouth they may be in design
       or expression, they must be tolerated for their age. It
       cannot be denied that some of them try our patience, in the
       epitaphs even more perhaps than in the carvings, and "merely
       mock whom they were meant to honour." Two out of a vast
       number may be selected as painful evidences of a departed
       century's tombstone ribaldry. The first, from a village near
       Bath, is a deplorable mixture of piety and profanity,
       sentiment and vulgarity:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"To the memory of Thomas and Richard Fry, stonemasons,
        who were crushed to death, Aug. the 25th, 1776, by the
        slipdown of a wall they were in the act of building. Thomas
        was 19 and Richard 21 years.</p>

        <p>"They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in
        death were not divided.</p>

        <p>"Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for their works
        follow them.</p>

        <p>"A sacred Truth: now learn our awful fate.</p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Dear Friends, we were first cousins, and what
            not:</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The other is at Cray ford, and is as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Here lieth the body of Peter Isnet, 30 years clerk of
        this parish. He lived respected as a Pious and a Mirthful
        Man, and died on his way to church to assist at a wedding
        on the 31st day of March 1811, aged 70 years. The
        inhabitants of Crayford have raised this stone to his
        cheerful memory and as a Tribute to his Long and Faithful
        Services.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The age of this clerk was just three score and
            ten,</p>

            <p>Nearly half of which time he had sung out
            <i>Amen!</i></p>

            <p>In his youth he was married, like other young
            men,</p>

            <p>But his wife died one day, and he chanted
            <i>Amen!</i></p>

            <p>A second he took. She departed: what then?</p>

            <p>He married and buried a third, with <i>Amen!</i></p>

            <p>Thus his joys and his sorrows were <i>Treble</i>,
            but then,</p>

            <p>His voice was deep <i>Bass</i> as he sung out
            <i>Amen!</i></p>

            <p>On the Horn he could blow as well as most men,</p>

            <p>So his horn was exalted in blowing <i>Amen!</i></p>

            <p>But he lost all his wind after Three Score and
            Ten,</p>

            <p>And here with Three Wives he waits till again</p>

            <p>The trumpet shall rouse him to sing out
            <i>Amen!</i>"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The habit of imitation which we have noticed in the masonry
    of the gravestone is even more pronounced in the epitaphs. One
    of the most familiar verses is that which usually reads:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Affliction sore long time I bore,</p>

            <p class="i6">Physicians were in vain,</p>

            <p>Till Death did seize and God did please</p>

            <p class="i6">To ease me of my pain."</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>

    <p>These lines, however, have undergone variations out of
    number, a not infrequent device being to adapt them to
    circumstances by such changes as&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Affliction sore short time I bore," etc.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The same idea has an extended application at the grave of
    Joseph Crate, who died in 1805, aged 42 years, and is buried at
    Hendon Churchyard:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Affliction sore long time I bore,</p>

            <p class="i6">Physicians were in vain:</p>

            <p>My children dear and wife, whose care</p>

            <p class="i6">Assuaged my every pain,</p>

            <p>Are left behind to mourn my fate:</p>

            <p class="i6">Then Christians let them find</p>

            <p>That pity which their case excites</p>

            <p class="i6">And prove to them most kind."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But the most startling perversion of the original text I saw
    in the churchyard at Saundersfoot, South Wales, where the
    stone-carver had evidently had his lesson by dictation, and
    made many original mistakes, the most notable of which was in
    the second line:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Affliction sore long time I bore,</p>

            <p class="i6"><i>Anitions</i> were in vain," etc.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The following from Hyden, Yorkshire, is remarkable:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"William Strutton, of Padrington, buried 18th May, 1734,
        aged 97 years, who had by his first wife 28 children, by
        his second, 17: was own father to 45, grandfather to 86,
        great-grandfather to 23; in all 154 children."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Witty tombstones, even when they are not vulgar, are always
    in bad taste. Two well-known instances may suffice&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>On Dr. Walker, who wrote a book on English</p>

            <p class="i4">Particles:</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="center">"Here lie Walker's Particles."</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>On Dr. Fuller:</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="center">"Here lies Fuller's
    Earth."</p>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109">
    </a>[pg 109]</span>
    <p>The same misplaced jocularity must be accountable for an
       enigmatical inscription at St. Andrew's, Worcester, on the
       tomb of a man who died in 1780, aged 65 years:</p>

    <p class="center">"H.L.T.B.O.<br />
    R.W.<br />
    I.H.O.A.J.R."</p>

    <p>This, we are told, should be read as follows:</p>

    <p class="center">"Here lyeth the Body of<br />
    Richard Weston<br />
    In hope of a Joyful Resurrection."</p>

    <p>Rhymed epitaphs have a history almost contemporaneous with
    that of the old gravestones, having their flourishing period
    between the middle of the seventeenth century and the early
    part of the nineteenth century. They were little used in
    England prior to the reign of James the First, and it is
    supposed that Mary, Queen of Scots, brought the custom from
    France. She is also said to have been an adept at composing
    epitaphs, and some attributed to her are extant.</p>

    <p>It may be suspected also that other inventors have written a
    vast number of the more or less apocryphal elegies which go to
    make up the many books of epitaphs which have been published;
    but this is a point wide of our subject, and we must be careful
    in our Rambles that we do not go astray.</p><br />

        2 of a periodical work entitled "Christian Monuments in
        England and Wales," proposing to complete the same in five
        sections; the fifth to treat of headstones and other
        churchyard memorials, with some general observations on
        modern monuments. The two parts brought the subject down to
        the fifteenth century, and were so ably written and
        beautifully illustrated as to intensify our regret at the
        incompletion of the task.</p>

        <p>The unhealthy practice of using churches for this
        purpose was continued some way into the nineteenth century.
        The still more objectionable plan of depositing coffins
        containing the dead in vaults under churches still lingers
        on. In 1875 I attended the funeral (so-called) of a public
        man, whose coffin was borne into the vaults of a town
        church, and left there, with scores of others piled in
        heaps in recesses which looked like wine-cellars. Not one
        of the many mourners who shared in that experience failed
        to feel horrified at the thought of such a fate. Some of
        the old coffins were tumbling to pieces, and the odour of
        the place was beyond description. In the words of Edmund
        Burke: "I would rather sleep in the southern corner of a
        country churchyard than in the tomb of the Capulets."</p>

        <p>In a barren record of facts, such as this chapter is
        meant to be, I avoid as far as possible deductions and
        reflections apart from my immediate subject; but it is
        impossible to pursue an investigation of this character
        without being deeply interested both in the past history
        and present life of the people. I cannot help saying that
        in one day's walk from Malahide to Balbriggan I learnt far
        more of the Irish peasantry, the Irish character, and the
        Irish "problem" than I had been able to acquire in all my
        reading, supported by not a little experience in the
        capital and great towns of Ireland. The village streets,
        the cabins, the schools, the agriculture and the land, the
        farmer and the landlord, the poverty and the hospitality of
        the people, were all to be studied at first hand; and there
        were churches by the way at Swords and Rush which the
        archaeologist will seek in vain to match in any other
        country. The Bound Tower (Celtic no doubt) at the former
        place, and the battlemented fortalice, which is more like a
        castle than a church, at Rush, are both worth a special
        visit.</p>

    <p class="center"><i>President of the Woolwich Antiquarian
    Society</i>.</p>

    Erith, and Bexley.</p>

    <h5>With Five Hundred Illustrations</h5>.
    <hr class="short" />

    <blockquote class="note"><p>
        The Work is Dedicated, by permission, to H.R.H. PRINCE
        ARTHUR, DUKE OF CONNAUGHT, and has been graciously accepted
        by HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and H.R.H. THE PRINCE OF WALES. It
        has also been universally extolled in the Press, from which
        the following are a few extracts:&mdash;</p>

        <p>"THE RECORDS OF WOOLWICH.&mdash;Mr. Freeman long ago
        suggested that it would be a useful division of labour if
        separate towns and districts were described by those in the
        several localities who had special knowledge on the
        subject, and he himself led the way in carrying out the
        design. Of local guide-books so called there is no end, but
        what is wanted in each case is an exhaustive history of the
        district, its natural formation, its antiquities, and the
        many objects of interest that are sure to abound, and that
        only want to be brought to light in order to form material
        for the future historian of the English nation. This labour
        Mr. W.T. Vincent proposes to perform for Woolwich in a work
        which he entitles 'The Records of the Woolwich District.'
        Mr. Vincent has been engaged in the task for twelve years.
        This is the work of a writer who has studied his subject in
        all the places where information can be obtained. The
        Preface alone will gain the reader's attention, even if the
        locality itself had no interest for him. It appears that
        Mr. Vincent had scented out the existence of a sealed
        packet of papers having reference to Woolwich, and, after a
        long hunt, ran the packet to earth in the British Museum.
        It was not until the authorities of the War Office had
        deliberated for a month on the subject that Mr. Vincent was
        allowed to see and open the packet, which was more than a
        hundred years old, and contained maps, plans, and views,
        several of which he produces."&mdash;<i>The Times</i>.</p>

        <p>"We must resist the temptation to extract, and conclude
        this notice by expressing our approval of the numerous
        <i>facsimile</i> reproductions of old prints illustrative
        of the text, each on a leaf of plate paper, while
        vignettes, maps, and plans are liberally dispersed through
        the letterpress, which is executed by Messrs. Virtue and
        Co., the well-known printers of the <i>Art Journal</i>. As
        to the text, the industry, care, research, and observation
        expended shew that it has been a labour of love. No
        prospect of profit could urge the production of such a
        work. It is, therefore, doubly reliable as a contribution
        to the antiquarian, topographical, anecdotal, pictorial,
        and descriptive history of an interesting locality,
        executed by a writer who is 'to the manner born.' We fully
        hope that Mr. Thomas Vincent, whose name is not unknown in
        the literary world, will reap his reward of fame and
        respect from his townsmen, and of fair profit, which his
        public spirit deserves."&mdash;<i>The Morning
        Advertiser</i>.</p>

        <p>"'The Records of the Woolwich District' deal with all
        the parishes which surround Shooters' Hill, necessarily
        dwelling most fully upon the northern slope. Of Shooters'
        Hill itself, and of all the other suburbs, some novel and
        attractive tidings may be expected."&mdash;<i>The Kentish
        Independent.</i></p>

        <p>"There can be no doubt that such a work, adequately and
        conscientiously executed, is much needed, and may be of
        great value. It has been undertaken by Mr. Vincent, well
        known as a journalist in the locality, and as the author of
        that useful directory 'Warlike Woolwich.' ... The printing
        has been entrusted to Messrs. Virtue and Co., the
        proprietors of the <i>Art Journal</i>, a sufficient
        guarantee for its quality. We are notified that there are
        over five hundred illustrations to be introduced, including
        a series of maps and drawings, included in the 'sealed
        packet,' and a hundred and fifty portraits of public
        persons, past and present. ... We hope the publication will
        command the success it deserves. The object of the author
        is evidently not mere money-making; he has undertaken the
        work from an earnest and enthusiastic desire to supply a
        worthy history of the locality with which he has been for
        his life connected, and we congratulate him upon the
        excellent promise of his First Number."&mdash;<i>The
        Kentish Mercury</i>.</p>

        <p>"The elegance of the illustrations at once attracts
        attention. The pictures, not only in their abundance and
        their interest, but in their exquisite presentment, are
        really excellent. Take the first of them, the charming view
        of 'Pleasant Little Woolwich,' a steel plate engraved in
        1798, and now reproduced by photographic process. The scene
        which it presents at a time when the author tells us this
        brick-covered, hard-working, dingy old town was a pretty
        village, and actually a fashionable watering-place, to
        which people came from London to recruit health, as they
        now go to Malvern and Scarborough, is delightful and
        refreshing beyond measure. The whole of these illustrations
        are indeed full of agreeable contemplation and fruitful in
        speculation.... He may honestly be congratulated on the
        product of his labours, which, he tells us, have been his
        recreation for many years. We can well believe it, and
        assure him, if he has any regrets at the impossibility of a
        pecuniary return, that the satisfaction which his book will
        give will be a full reward. Such books seldom pay; they are
        not expected to do so, and any one may tell that there is
        no profit in the venture. But it will supply a need, and
        the writer's name will be handed down to posterity as
        having provided a very agreeable book."&mdash;<i>The
        Woolwich Gazette</i>.</p>

        <p>"The neighbourhood, rich as it is in historical
        material, has hitherto met with scanty recognition from
        historians, and we welcome Mr. Vincent's efforts to supply
        the need, and the generous spirit of his labours. He has
        spared no pains to make the records complete. Patient
        research and much literary skill are combined in the
        letterpress and woodcuts, engravings, drawings, and
        photographs, with maps and plans, which have been lavishly
        introduced by way of illustration .... We content ourselves
        now with pointing out its great value and entertaining
        power. The style is easy, and the writer is happily
        successful in his endeavour to avoid any appearance of
        merely dry-as-dust research."&mdash;<i>The Eltham, Sidcup,
        and District Times</i>.</p>

        <p>"It is a work which should prove of vast interest in our
        district, and we ought to say very far beyond it, for there
        must be many who, though not now residing in the area
        comprised in the 'Records,' would be glad to possess the
        book on its existence becoming known."&mdash;<i>The Erith
        Times</i>.</p>

        <p>"Mr. W.T. Vincent's 'Records of the Woolwich District'
        is undoubtedly the first volume which pretends to give a
        full and concise history of the whole
        district."&mdash;<i>The Bexley Heath and Erith
        Observer</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
